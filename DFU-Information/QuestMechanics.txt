    "create foe" creates all foes on their natural team, NOT on player enemy. Make sure to assign
    them to a common team if you don't want them infighting.

    You can "create foe" and then immediately afterward declare infighting for the enemy if it's one,
    it should hold.

    You can declare infighting for an enemy any time after you use "place foe" and it should hold.

    _infight_ mechanic of "daily from 0:00 to 23:59" is the easiest way to establish constant
    teamchange/infighting change, haven't yet identified other methods to do so. "pc at" doesn't work unless
    you're using "spam spawning" like in Death's Embrace.
