QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                        DFU NOBLE QUEST
<ce>          
<ce>          %pcf, in this line of work, people must
<ce>           be held to account. Once word gets out
<ce>           that _questgiver_'s a weak-kneed
<ce>           coward, all kinds of filth come through the
<ce>           door to take advantage of me. I must
<ce>            make things right before they go more
<ce>           wrong. Will you avenge me of a foe
<ce>              of mine for _reward_ gold pieces?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                Then leave me, lest you betray me too.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             According to a prior arrangement, I bought
<ce>             _res_ from the bank and gave
<ce>              it to someone who at the time was destitute
<ce>           and without hope. Three years have passed, I am
<ce>           informed of several prosperous businesses run by
<ce>           the formerly hopeless scoundrel, and yet I receive
<ce>            no payments for the house. My previous couriers
<ce>            have been turned away with no response, which
<ce>             means I no longer have need of couriers. The
<ce>              cretin will most certainly attempt to remove you
<ce>            from the property by force. Respond in kind,
<ce>              %ra, and relieve me of this enemy. The bank
<ce>               will buy the home back within 72 hours. I
<ce>                        need to hear from you by then.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               What, are you also begging for
<ce>                 a house after failing me?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>           This pleases me more than I can
<ce>            express, %pcf. Feel pride in being
<ce>           the instrument of justice this day.
<ce>            Here are the _reward_ gold pieces.
<ce>            Let no man tell you _questgiver_
<ce>          does not deal honorably with his own.

Message:  1020
<ce>               _questgiver_'s adversary is no more. 
<ce>                  Now justice may run its course.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 needs me to forcibly remove
 from _res_
 its owner who has refused to
 honor a property agreement.
 I must return within 72 hours.

Message:  1099
<ce>         I'm not giving _res_ to
<ce>         you, %pcf, and certainly not if you're
<ce>         unwilling to dispose of its squatting owner.
<ce>         I gave you three days to finish this.
