<ce>  Oh! You startled me. A letter? For me?
<ce>  Um, okay. Delivery fee of =reward_ gold.
<ce>  Well, here you go. Be safe.
<--->
<ce>  Hello! Yes, I've been expecting that letter.
<ce>  I'll take that, and you take this.
<--->
<ce>  A letter? I'm not expecting any letter.
<ce>  This better not be a trick.
<ce>  Take your money and go.
<--->
<ce>  Oh my! This must be about my mother.
<ce>  I've been worried sick!
<ce>  Thank you, and take this money.
<--->
<ce>  Finally, some news from my beloved!
<ce>  Take your money, this means so much to me.
<--->
<ce>  Oh dear, another debt collection notice.
<ce>  Take this money and tell no one you saw me.
<--->
<ce>  A letter. This better be important.
<ce>  Fighters Guild recruitment?
<ce>  Are they so desperate that they send letters now?
<ce>  Well, I'll get reimbursement for this delivery.
<ce>  You take your =reward_ gold.
<--->
<ce>  A letter for me? Wait, let me see what it says.
<ce>  
 "_person_,
    You are a thief. Do not
 try to deny it, you have
 been seen in the act. There
 is honor among thieves.
 Either join the guild or
 face the consequences."
<ce>   
<ce>  Oh dear. Go now. Now. Take your money and hurry on.
<--->
<ce>  Oh no, I've been expecting this letter. Oh dear.
<ce>  Yes, my grandfather has passed away.
<ce>  It's time to tie up loose ends.
<ce>  Thank you. Take your fee.
<--->
<ce>  A delivery for me? What?
<ce>  This is just an advertisement
<ce>  for a blacksmith up the way.
<ce>  I'll pay you, but I'm going to raise
<ce>  Oblivion with these devils for wasting
<ce>  my time and money like this. Get going, now.
<--->
<ce>  A letter for me? Oh wow! A birthday party!
<ce>  This sounds like fun! I'll get my things in
<ce>  order and make the trip. Thank you!
<ce>  Here, this is yours.
<--->
<ce>  Oh, the letter arrived! My sister is
<ce>  doing so well with the Mages Guild,
<ce>  I get so excited to hear how she's doing.
<ce>  I can't wait to read it! Here, take
<ce>  your money and get going.
<--->
<ce>  Oh, wonderful! It's this month's letter.
<ce>  My brother works for the %rt
<ce>  and has so many fascinating stories to tell.
<ce>  Here, take what's yours and let me read.
<--->
<ce>  Another cursed letter from my estranged family.
<ce>  I'll pay your fee, but they need to get their act together.
<ce>  Might find an axe in their door one of these days.
<ce>  Go on, scram.
<--->
<ce>  Oh, thank you! This is from my sister. She's traveling
<ce>  across the Bay and wanted me to know she made it safely.
<ce>  What a relief! Here, take your fee.
<--->
<ce>  Oh, dear. My mother has passed away, and it seems
<ce>  we need to get our family business in order.
<ce>  It'll be quite messy, I can say that much.
<ce>  Here, take your gold.
