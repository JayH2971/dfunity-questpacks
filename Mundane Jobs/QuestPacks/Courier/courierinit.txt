Message:  1011
<ce>  You notice a small chest on the ground with a hopeful note.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Courier wanted! Deliver letters to persons as you travel.
<ce>  Pay between 25 and 75 gold per letter delivered.
<ce>  Letters will appear in this box and must be hand-delivered
<ce>  to the recipient, who will tender payment."
<ce>  
<ce>  No one else seems to pay the container any mind.
<ce>  If you're looking for a way to earn some money,
<ce>  this seems like a simple start. Do you take it?

Message:  1012
<ce>  You leave the chest alone. Someone else will
<ce>  have to make couriership their duty.

Message:  1013
<ce>  You pick up the chest and look inside.
<ce>  It's empty right now, but once the owner
<ce>  realizes that you've taken up the task,
<ce>  letters will presumably show up within.
<ce>  
<ce>  (NOTE: To give up this job,
<ce>  activate the "Use" command on this chest
<ce>  in your inventory.)
