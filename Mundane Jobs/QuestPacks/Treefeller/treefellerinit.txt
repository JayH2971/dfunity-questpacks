Message:  1011
<ce>  You notice an axe on the ground. It seems to be made for woodcutting,
<ce>  though if you were really desperate, it could also serve as a weapon.
<ce>  If you felt any confidence in lumberwork, you could take it with you.
<ce>  Do you take it?

Message:  1012
<ce>  You leave the axe alone. Someone else will
<ce>  make gainful employ with it.

Message:  1013
<ce>  You pick up the axe and inspect it.
<ce>  It looks fine enough for the job.
<ce>  As long as you're in any place with trees nearby,
<ce>  it should provide you with a reasonable income.
<ce>  
<ce>  (NOTE: To use the axe,
<ce>  activate the "Use" command on it
<ce>  in your inventory.)
