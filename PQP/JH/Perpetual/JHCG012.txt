<ce>   Your assignment to provide a chart

<ce>        As I might have mentioned, we'll probably be
<ce>        sending you back to Shedungent time and again.
<ce>        Queen Aubk-i has a particular interest in her
<ce>        grandmother-in-law's dwelling place. But once
<ce>        you know where it is, this is easy money.

<ce>        you a letter. "You must be %pcf.
<ce>        This belongs to you." He then moves on.

  %pcf,
 
  I can't remember whether we've sent you
  to Shedungent yet, in the Wrothgarian
  Mountains. If so, please forgive us for
  this assignment. You will be paid as well as
  in every other case. We need you to chart
  the distance from there to here. Speak to
  me if you need directions to it. This needs
  to be done within =timer_ days.

<ce>        Always a pleasure, %pcf. Shedungent is quite far out there,
<ce>        which makes it an important target to chart once and again.
<ce>        The former Queen Mother, Nulfaga, is also there. We try
<ce>        not to bother her for good reasons.
 
<ce>        If you don't know where it is, I will warn you it isn't easy to find.
<ce>        It's east of Kieran Theatre and south of The Hearthhouse Tombs.
<ce>        Go to Longwell in the Wrothgarian Mountains. Leave to the
<ce>        south-southeast until you're directly between The Greensley
<ce>        Plantation and The Greensly Farmstead. From there, head directly south.
<ce>        It's in a low point in the ground, so use the hills to your advantage.
 
<ce>        Alternatively you could start from The Greensley Plantation and
<ce>        go east-southeast, but that'll usually get you lost pretty fast.
<ce>        Just keep looking around there. I assure you it's there, somewhere.
<ce>        It's a peculiar building, all black with a staircase up one side and a
<ce>        straw roof. Come back when you've found it, in no more than =timer_ days.

Message:  1013
<ce>        You recognize this as Shedungent.
<ce>        It's time to get back to ___qg_.
<--->
<ce>        Now that you've scouted Shedungent,
<ce>        it's time to give your report to _qg_.

 I've been assigned to map
 the distance from Shedungent
 to ___place_ in
 ____place_. I have =timer_
 days to travel to do this and
 report to _qg_.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 _qg_ gave me these steps
 to reach Shedungent. From Longwell,
 I can go south-southeast until I'm between
 The Greensley Plantation and The
 Greensly Farmstead, and then south.
 I could also start at The Greensley
 Plantation and go east-southeast, but 
 %g1 warned me that's the harder route.
 I also noted it's east of Kieran Theatre
 and south of The Hearthhouse Tombs.

Message:  1099
<ce>  I warn you not to enter Shedungent.
<ce>  I've lost a couple people over the years
<ce>  who did so. Just chart it and return.
