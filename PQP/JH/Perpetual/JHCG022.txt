<ce>        A beautiful sight, isn't it Pathfinder?
<ce>        A lone altar, a majestic hill, and the sight
<ce>        of the boundless ocean before you. That's
<ce>        always a favorite. I hope it is for you, too.
<ce>        Take your pay. We'll be in contact.

<ce>        A page calls out to you and absentmindedly
<ce>        hands you a parchment.
<--->
<ce>        A courier silently passes a letter to you
<ce>        before moving on to other tasks.

  Pathfinder,
 
  Your assignment at this time is to chart the
  Coven on the Bluff. That's in Daggerfall. Please
  see me if you need directions.

<ce>        A pleasure to see you, %pcf. You'll
<ce>        start at Burning Martyr of Kynareth in
<ce>        the Daggerfall region. It's by the coast
<ce>        on the west side. March south on the hills
<ce>        above the coastline. It shouldn't take you
<ce>        very long before you see an open clearing
<ce>        with an altar and a single witch. When
<ce>        you're done come back to me with your
<ce>        report and you'll get your pay.

Message:  1013
<ce>        You see the Coven on the Bluff before you.
<--->
<ce>        A witch gestures to you before returning
<ce>        to a ritual of some kind. This must
<ce>        be the coven you were sent to.

%qdt:
 _qg_ told me to start at
 Burning Martyr of Kynareth in
 the Daggerfall region. The coven
 should be a short walk to the south.
 It'll be in an open clearing above
 the ocean, on a hill crest.

<ce>  Look for an open clearing to
<ce>  the south of Burning Martyr of
<ce>  Kynareth. You'll see the altar.
