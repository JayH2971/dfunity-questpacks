<ce>   The Cartographers assigned you to
<ce>   chart the Wroth Coven by now.

<ce>        Well done, %pcf. These things are
<ce>        always a bother to find at the first, but once
<ce>        you've done it, you can keep doing the task
<ce>        with perfect confidence. We may never run
<ce>        out of charting assignments, even if you find
<ce>        yourself at the same locations once and again.

  Pathfinder,
 
  We need you to chart the Wroth Coven,
  in the Wrothgarian Mountains. I'm in
  ___place_ in case you need instructions.
  You have =timer_ days to fulfill this task.

<ce>        Of course I'll help you, %pcf.
<ce>        Start in the village of Deerville in the
<ce>        Wrothgarian Mountains. Specifically,
<ce>        stand next to a store called Deerville's Best
<ce>        General Store, and march east. If you follow
<ce>        that direction precisely, you should walk right
<ce>        over the stone circle of the Wroth Coven.
<ce>        There aren't any nearby landmarks or hills, so
<ce>        unfortunately that's all the direction I can give
<ce>        you. I will add that it's no further than
<ce>        two leagues out. Don't go wandering off into
<ce>        Skyrim looking for it. We've given you =timer_
<ce>        days to do this task.

<ce>        This must be the Wroth Coven.

<ce>        You've found the Wroth Coven. Now it's
<ce>        time to report to _qg_.

 The Cartographers have sent me to
 the Wroth Coven in the Wrothgarian
 Mountains. I have =timer_ days to find
 it and arrive at ___place_
 in ____place_ for my reward.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 _qg_ said I should go to Deerville, to
 Deerville's Best General Store, and then
 just walk east. The coven is a stone circle
 in the middle of the greenery, not further
 than two leagues from the village.

Message:  1099
<ce>  It's not always easy to find, since there
<ce>  aren't any landmarks besides Deerville.
<ce>  Watch for the jagged stones in the coven.
