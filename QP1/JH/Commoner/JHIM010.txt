QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             My name is _qg_. I have come into possession
<ce>        of a map purporting to lead to some forgotten treasure
<ce>        in %crn. I consider myself incapable of recovering it,
<ce>      but I would be willing to sell it for the mere pittance of
<ce>            200 gold pieces. Would this interest you, %ra?
                                     <--->
<ce>            Good day, %ra. I have here a map leading to a
<ce>             forgotten treasure in %crn, which I would be
<ce>              willing to part with for 200 gold pieces.
<ce>                 Would you consider that a good deal?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  %oth. Tell your friends about me.
                                     <--->
<ce>                What a pity, for I will not go lower.
                                     <--->
<ce>                    I suppose I should look for an
<ce>                   adventurer. Forgive the mistake.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Good, very good. Talk to me in a moment
<ce>                   and we'll make the transaction.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               As authentic as the treasure map may be,
<ce>          someone is likely to have found its bounty by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               This appears to be the fabled treasure.

Message:  1020
<ce>             Very good, thank you for waiting. I'll take
<ce>                     your 200 gold. That's good.
<ce>
<ce>              No refunds, I should state, but that's an
<ce>                 obvious assumption by all parties in
<ce>               transactions such as these. There is no
<ce>               hope of restoring it beyond its current
<ce>               condition. Take it, see if it makes you
<ce>                 rich beyond your wildest dreams, and
<ce>                   come tell me about it some time.
<ce>              My curiosity will itch at me until I hear
<ce>                 regarding the matter. Farewell, %ra.

<ce>                I see you don't have 200 gold pieces.
<ce>              What a pity. I certainly hope to be taken
<ce>               seriously by the next potential client.
