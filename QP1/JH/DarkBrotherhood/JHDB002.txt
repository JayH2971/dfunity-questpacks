<ce>  %pct, it is the Brotherhood's prerogative
<ce>  to maintain a balance in nature when it has been
<ce>  altered. This time-honored purpose is the anchor to
<ce>  our connections, civil and royal, throughout Tamriel.
<ce>  What that balance actually means is generally
<ce>  left to the highest bidder's imagination, but we
<ce>  have no qualms using our skills to satisfy needs.
<ce>  Will you slay an errant knight and serve your
<ce>  fellow beings in ___qgiver_?
<--->
<ce>  Tales across Tamriel tell of knights who restore
<ce>  order, rescue damsels, and protect nobles from
<ce>  people like us. We feel particular joy when an
<ce>  accounting is requested against such. Will you
<ce>  slay a weakling knight in ___qgiver_?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Keep turning away our offers. Soon the
<ce>  Brotherhood will close its doors to you.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> This complaint is against some warrior over
<ce> in _knightly_. The loudmouth keeps
<ce> running on about some spectacular adventures
<ce> and being a part of the Knights of the True Horn,
<ce> supposedly. ___qgiver_ won't
<ce> miss this raucous distraction much. You
<ce> will return here within twelve hours.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Well done, %pct. Understand that
<ce>  your charitable act is its own reward.
<ce>  The Night Mother recognizes those who
<ce> stay zealous in her service in due time.

<ce> What fool challenges me?!
<ce> I've slain liches and harpies!
<ce> You don't scare me!

%qdt:
 The Dark Brotherhood has
 sent me to slay a knight
 in _knightly_.
 I have twelve hours to
 do it and return.

<ce> "The Knights of the True Horn...
<ce>  will hunt you down..."
<ce>  
<ce> This knight's faded insignia says
<ce>  otherwise. Your work here is done.

Message:  1099
<ce>  Did you get lost outside? If you
<ce> find yourself among the trees, 
<ce>  consult your map and try again.
<ce> This isn't a hard task, %pct.
