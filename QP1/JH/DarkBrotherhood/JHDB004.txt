<ce>  %pct, we have no qualms with the adherents
<ce>  to religious study and practice. Their gods do
<ce>  not interfere with our god, and therefore they
<ce>  live. Nevertheless, a contract has recently arrived
<ce>  to request the end of a particularly nosy preacher
<ce>  in ___questgiver_. Will you serve the
<ce>  Night Mother by doing the Brotherhood's work?
<--->
<ce>  For obvious reasons we rarely send our members
<ce>  to _temple_. Usually their
<ce>  practitioners and ours are incompatible, lending
<ce>  to an uncomfortable friction. Yet even they will
<ce>  occasionally request our aid as a last resort
<ce>  when kind words and uncomfortable glances
<ce>  are not enough. We have on our hands an
<ce>  errant cleric who requires an accounting.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> What easier task do you seek, %pct?
<ce> Shining someone's boots? Combing some hair?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> This complaint concerns a priest in
<ce> _temple_ who has
<ce> shown little of the restraint and etiquette
<ce> necessary for a preacher of morality.
<ce> Some say this cleric has gone too far.
<ce> One is paying us to prove it. Bring balance
<ce> to ___questgiver_ and return
<ce> within twelve hours.

<ce> Very good, %pct. May Mephala
<ce> guide you in your future service
<ce> to the Dark Brotherhood.

Message:  1022
<ce> Look how even the common criminal
<ce> passes through the door of our
<ce>  temple! Have at you and be one
<ce> with the dust of the earth!

Message:  1032
%qdt:
 The Dark Brotherhood has
 sent me to slay a priest
 in _temple_.
 I have twelve hours to
 do it and return.

Message:  1042
<ce>  "May the doors of this temple
<ce> be closed to you forever!"
<ce> 
<ce> The priest lets out one final gasp
<ce> and collapses. The other members
<ce> are not so convinced of this fool's
<ce> pronouncement. Your work here is done.

Message:  1099
<ce>  Do you know what a temple looks
<ce>  like, %pct? Go there. Kill the priest.
<ce>  Come here. This is simple.
