<ce>  Certain works can only be entrusted to
<ce>  one of your rank. We have a task of great
<ce>  importance to Tamriel's future, but there
<ce>  will only be one chance to execute it.
<ce>  Fail, and the consequences will be severe.
<ce>  But your success will bring great glory
<ce>  to yourself and the Brotherhood.
<ce>  Will you take it up at this time?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  If I find someone capable first, it
<ce>  will go to them. We cannot wait forever.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  Then swear to me that you will tell no
<ce>  being, living or dead, what I now impart.
<ce>  
<ce>  An ambassador from the Imperial City has
<ce>  traveled to the court of Wayrest to
<ce>  "discuss the future" of the Orcish race.
<ce>  Populous as the greenskins are, the Emperor
<ce>  commands armies sufficient to eradicate them
<ce>  in their current state. That may come to pass
<ce>  sooner rather than later at the instigation of
<ce>  this agent, who must be slain. This petition comes
<ce>  from Gortwog, lord of the orcs.
<ce>  
<ce>  The Brotherhood has no stake in this matter other
<ce>  than that we have been hired for it. Your partner
<ce>  will be a magician, another of our highest-ranking
<ce>  members in %crn. She has gone ahead to
<ce>  the court of Wayrest and has orders to
<ce>  await you there for =timer_ days.
<ce>  Look for someone inside Wayrest Palace who
<ce>  asks, "How long will the Septims reign?"
<ce>  Answer, "Every year they must."
<ce>  Then press your thumb into her palm.
<ce>  She will guide you from there.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  Off to Wayrest, %pcf.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  She smiles and leans in closer.

Message:  1010
<ce>  The Dark Brotherhood's magician will be somewhere here.

Message:  1011
<ce>  "Hello there. I haven't seen you in these parts."
<ce>  
<ce>  You are surprised by a voice behind you. Turning
<ce>  around, you meet the piercing gaze of a woman.
<ce>  
<ce>  "It's so hard to find even one %ra loyal
<ce>  to the Empire. Tell me, how long will
<ce>  the Septims reign?"
<ce>  
<ce>  Do you give the answer _qgiver_ told you?

Message:  1012
<ce>  "Well, I must be going. Enjoy your stay in Wayrest, stranger."
<ce>  
<ce>  She leaves you alone and attends to other duties.
<ce>  You are no longer involved in this plot.
