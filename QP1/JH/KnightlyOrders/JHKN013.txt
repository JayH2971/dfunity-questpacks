<ce>                     A local townsperson has been
<ce>                  cursed by a wizard with a locating
<ce>         spell. The cowardly maniac sends magical constructs
<ce>             with a killing directive.. We need a skilled
<ce>               warrior to slay them all until the curse
<ce>                      loses its power. Will you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 The poor child is unfit for combat.
<ce>                 I foresee a very bad ending for him
<ce>                    unless I find someone quickly.

<ce>             "An answer worthy of our order. The attacks
<ce>            are sparing, sometimes spaced across days, but
<ce>             they will come, I assure you. Just go about
<ce>            your ordinary life in the mean time. Gallant?"
<ce>
<ce>         A knight leaves the building, and soon returns with
<ce>          another person in tow, surrounded by a dark aura.
<ce>
<ce>                    "_escort_, we have found your
<ce>               protector. %pcn will stay with you until
<ce>                we are certain the danger has passed.
<ce>              Follow wherever %pcf leads you, no matter
<ce>                          what. Understood?"

<ce>                  As this atronach falls, _escort_'s
<ce>                complexion changes entirely. The dark
<ce>                 covering around %g2 disappears in an
<ce>            instant. %g1 smiles and thanks you profusely.
<ce>
<ce>                "I'm sorry I have no means to pay you,
<ce>                  but I will speak with _questgiver_
<ce>                 as soon as I am able. You have saved
<ce>                   my life! I will not forget it!"
<ce>
<ce>                        _escort_ heads on %g3
<ce>                     way, and you are left alone.

Message:  1010
<ce>               Words barely creep out of %g3 mouth. You
<ce>           miss what is said, but it likely doesn't matter.
                                     <--->
<ce>                      _escort_'s gaunt eyes tell
<ce>              a long tale. %g1 likely has only slept on
<ce>             horseback if the assaults have persisted so.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ has assigned
 me to protect _escort_
 of ___questgiver_ from
 a wizard's curse consisting
 of magical attackers.
 My role is to strike them
 down until the curse wears out.

<ce>                      You're free to roam, %pcf.
<ce>                   Go wherever you like, so long as
<ce>                       you keep _escort_ safe.
