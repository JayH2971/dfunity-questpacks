<ce>  %pcf, we believe we have a simple task for you.
<ce>  One of our members brought back this _tri_ that
<ce>  we consider to have magical properties. However, ordinary 
<ce>  identification spells fail us, and testing it directly seems
<ce>  like a dangerously absurd proposition, knowing it could
<ce>  hold any effect in Tamriel. What the Odylic Mages
<ce>  cannot identify, one of our greater experts can.
<ce>  Please deliver it for identification.
<--->
<ce>  One of the grandiose mysteries of Tamriel is
<ce>  that there are simply forms of magic and power
<ce>  we do not yet understand. My sincerest desire
<ce>  is that the empire will last another 1500 years
<ce>  so we may have time to unravel every enigma
<ce>  across the world itself in peace. But to
<ce>  get to the point, a very strange _tri_ was
<ce>  delivered to us recently with a latent enchantment
<ce>  we cannot draw out. The regular identification
<ce>  spells avail us nothing. This requires the help of
<ce>  a true expert. Will you take it into the ruins
<ce>  to obtain that manner of help?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  Even so, we refuse to test it in this guild hall.
<ce>  The risks are too great.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  Very well, here it is. I would ask you not to tamper with
<ce>  it, but I doubt you could in any case. If our specialists
<ce>  could not unleash its power, so much less will you. You
<ce>  will most likely find _npc_ in a hole
<ce>  called ___dung_. Please treat %g2 with respect,
<ce>  for %g1 is a former member of the Guild. We do not want some
<ce>  controversy to arise merely because someone cannot control %pg3
<ce>  tongue. I will see you here within =timer_ days to hear
<ce>  _npc_'s report. %god watch over you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  You had the audacity to slay _npc_? What madness
<ce>  has overcome you? If I have my way, the mop and pail will
<ce>  not leave your hands for the next year. What a disgusting
<ce>  outcome to a simple task. Say nothing more of this. I
<ce>  assure you, the council will learn all it needs to.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  Oh my, our poor _npc_! What an awful trap!
<ce>  We owe you much this day, %pct. Had you slain %g2,
<ce>  we would have lost one of our foremost experts on arcane
<ce>  artifacts. Well done, my child! Please take this reward
<ce>  for uncovering the secret within the _tri_. What we
<ce>  do with it is now in the council's hands.

Message:  1010
<ce>  "Ah, good day. Yes, I am _npc_. What do you need
<ce>  of me? Hmm. Well, I suppose I can take a look at it. It's just
<ce>  this _tri_? Very well. Allow me to work on it for a moment."
<ce>  
<ce>  You hold the trinket in front of %g2, which %g1 touches while
<ce>  chanting an incantation. A burst of light follows which leaves
<ce>  you unsettled. Once your eyes adjust, you see a very different
<ce>  demeanor on _npc_'s face.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Filthy, disgusting %ra! This is my home! What are you
<ce>  doing in my home?! Murder! Murder! This day to Oblivion!"

<ce>  _npc_ lies dead. You put the _tri_ in your pack.

Message: 1012
<ce>  _npc_ halts midstep. Lucidity appears
<ce>  to return to %g3 eyes, and %g1 trembles.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Oh, my. Oh, dear. I didn't hurt you, did I? What
<ce>  an awful, awful trap was put on this simple little thing!
<ce>  One of us could have been killed! Oh, I feel faint.
<ce>  Tell _qgiver_ we now know everything we
<ce>  need to about that device. And tell %g2 to burn it.
<ce>  I would do so myself if I weren't convinced it would
<ce>  arouse the Archmagister's wrath. Go in peace,
<ce>  %ra, and thank you for sparing my life."

Message: 1013
<ce>  Do you tell _qgiver_ you slew _npc_?

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 The Mages Guild of ___qgiver_
 has tasked me with taking some
 _tri_ to _npc_, who is
 in __dung_, for inspection.
 I should return in =timer_ days
 with the report.

Message:  1031
