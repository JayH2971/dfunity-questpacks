QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> Oh, %oth. I had put this one
<ce> in the back of my mind, and here it
<ce> is again. Rid me of this unpleasant
<ce> thought, will you %pcf? One
<ce> of our guild members was assaulted while
<ce> bringing notes from one of the more
<ce> brilliant scholars of %crn.
<ce> A kindly informant has told us where
<ce> the Dark Brotherhood knave absconded
<ce> to. In the face of danger, will you
<ce> stand firm to retrieve the research?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Ah, one of those brave ones when
<ce> no danger is present. Of course.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Then make haste to slay this subhuman filth
<ce> and bring the papers back. I will need
<ce> them in =timer_ days time, lest we lose
<ce> face with the scholarly community.
<ce> No one should know this ever happened,
<ce> other than the despicable Dark Brotherhood.
<ce> Oh, how my blood boils! Off with you now!
<ce> _res_, ___res_! Now!

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> _qgiver_ demanded the lost
<ce> research notes by today.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Oh, what a joy! I've managed to keep it
<ce> a secret in the meantime. How wonderful!
<ce> These =reward_ gold pieces will go unnoticed.
<ce> Have them, and remember, tell no soul of this.

The manner by which the diastolic pressure
 of any two scarce commodities (creating a
 type of propulsion with no moving parts
 and virtual silence) has been postulated
 by thyrionic mathematicians for many years.
 In conventional thinking, the default
 parameters of any formula (objectively
 speaking, it is essential to remember that
 objectivity is indeed subjective) will
 always return to what Mornthaur called the
 "back medium." However, starting with a
 grid of complex numbers that more than covers
 the unit circle and three cube roots of one,
 we can backtrace, by uptracking the negative
 "half numbers," and create an infinite basin
 with dual natures of blackness and whiteness.
 The rate of adiabatic cooling or warming in
 unsaturated air can thus be made directly
 proportional to the fourth power of its
 absolute temperature.
