QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  %pcf, you have earned the Archmage's trust,
<ce>  and therefore are privvy to some rather
<ce>  sensitive matters. By regiment of the law,
<ce>  the Mages Guild bears the duty of seeking
<ce>  out and purging any influence of the
<ce>  Necromancers in the Iliac Bay, especially
<ce>  among our own members. Nevertheless the
<ce>  task is not always so simple, and we require
<ce>  sometimes subtle and clever practitioners
<ce>  of the arts of speech to ferret out the
<ce>  truth as necessary. Are you so skilled
<ce>  and willing to uncover a possible Necromancer?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  Hmph. Does trust mean nothing to you?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  Well then, your task will take you to _nhome_.
<ce>  Speak to _nec_ and say whatever you
<ce>  need to uncover the truth. I assume %g1 retires
<ce>  there at night, so go in the late hours. Surely
<ce>  your knowledge of magic thus far may aid you
<ce>  in providing a proper context. Return here with
<ce>  the knowledge you glean and leave the rest
<ce>  to us. You have one day to do this.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  The Mages Guild asked you to report on
<ce>  _nec_'s supposed necromancy by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  _qgiver_ hands you your reward with a kindly smile.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
I couldn't be happier about that dead Necromancer. ____nhome_'s doing its work.
<--->
The Necromancer of ___nhome_ was slain!

Message:  1028
<ce>  Yes? I'm quite busy. I hope this is important.

Message:  1029
<ce>  So you say you have an interest in power beyond what
<ce>  the Mages Guild can offer. Those are inspiring, and
<ce>  yet dangerous, lines of thinking. Do you truly believe
<ce>  there is power to rival or even exceed that held
<ce>  by the Council of the Archmages?

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of the Mages Guild
 has sent me to meet with _nec_ to
 determine whether %g1 has ties
 to the Necromancers. I should go
 at night to _nhome_
 and take less than a single day.

Message:  1031
<ce>  I will admit I have considered these things in the
<ce>  past. Surely there is more magicka in the world than
<ce>  that found in the six schools taught
<ce>  by the Guild, wouldn't you agree?
<--->
<ce>  I believe so myself. I myself have come to
<ce>  think that there is more magicka out there than
<ce>  in merely six schools alone, those regulated
<ce>  by imperial rule. At least, it makes sense
<ce>  to me. Wouldn't you agree that there is more
<ce>  to learn than what is being formally taught?

Message:  1032
<ce>  Indeed, censorship of the magicka is something
<ce>  that has concerned myself and others for quite some
<ce>  time. I myself believe people should be free to
<ce>  use whatever magicks they choose and allow the
<ce>  criminal justice system to punish actual offenses
<ce>  against society, not merely crimes of mentality
<ce>  determined by a council of elder wizards.
<ce>  Does that sound so unreasonable?
<--->
<ce>  To be sure, there is a reason for such order as it stands,
<ce>  and it should not be flaunted at every user's whim. But
<ce>  we must agree that some orders are based not on
<ce>  practicality or experience, but the outdated and flawed
<ce>  perceptions of certain elder wizards on a council.
<ce>  Is that such a disagreeable thought?

Message:  1033
<ce>  I see that you are serious. Will you keep our
<ce>  conversation here private, taking it down
<ce>  with you to the grave?
<--->
<ce>  Hmm. I wish to trust you, but I cannot do so without
<ce>  an oath. Do you swear to keep our conversation here
<ce>  private, taking it down with you to the grave?

Message:  1034
<ce>  I accept your word of honor. Now, to speak plainly.
<ce>  Would you have qualms discussing a particular branch of
<ce>  Restoration magic involving the resurrection of the dead?
<--->
<ce>  I accept your oath. Now then, to the point. Do you find offense
<ce>  in a branch of restorative magic that is capable of returning
<ce>  life to the dead?

Message:  1035
<ce>  Well, that is precisely the kind of magic that is outlawed
<ce>  by the Mages Guild. What a miserable waste! Imagine that,
<ce>  if we could merely return Lysandus to corporeal form instead
<ce>  of attempting to whisper to his ghost! Can you see what
<ce>  value there is in occasionally straying from the
<ce>  constricting bounds determined by the Council?
<--->
<ce>  And that is precisely the problem with the imperial Mages Guild.
<ce>  Take the Lysandus crisis. Why should we go waste time questioning
<ce>  who slew whom on what day, if we could merely return his spirit to
<ce>  his body? Is that not an obviously legitimate use of magicka?

Message:  1036
<ce>  Then perhaps we have more in common than I previously detected.
<ce>  I demand that you tell me how you found me and why you ask.
<ce>  
<ce>  I see. Your attempts to speak to other guild members about
<ce>  this will arouse great ire, and doubtless oblige the town guard
<ce>  to carry you to the gallows. Powerful restoration, as we may
<ce>  term it, is a serious offense requiring the life of the practitioner
<ce>  in %crn. Say no more to any other person concerning it.
<ce>  Ensure that no one knows what we have spoken this night.
<ce>  I will look for you in a few weeks' time, when I am certain of my
<ce>  decision in this matter. Maintain silence. Good night, %pcf.

Message:  1037
<ce>  This conversation has provided you with ample evidence that
<ce>  _nec_ is indeed a Necromancer. _qgiver_
<ce>  instructed you to report the matter to %g2, but surely
<ce>  an immediate solution is of greater value. Will you
<ce>  attempt to carry out the execution?

Message:  1038
<ce>  _nec_'s eyes smolder.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Fool! You know nothing of the power I wield!"
<ce>  
<ce>  Casting a spell, %g3 appearance changes radically.

Message:  1039
<ce>  By slaying _nec_ you have done a great service to
<ce>  ___nhome_. _qgiver_ will want to know about this.

Message:  1040
<ce>  Surely discretion is merited in such cases as these.
<ce>  You decide to return to _qgiver_
<ce>  and report the matter through the official channels.

Message:  1041
<ce>  What's this? Not only did _nec_ confess
<ce>  to the crime of necromancy, you slew him in combat?
<ce>  Oh my word! And such power he wielded! %pct,
<ce>  your service this day will not be forgotten!
<ce>  How many others could have died attempting to
<ce>  apprehend him! Apprentice! Excuse me, could
<ce>  you go back into storage and get that
<ce>  trinket we were discussing this morning?
<ce>  %pcf needs it, for such an act does not merit
<ce>  gold alone. Oh, thank you my friend! You
<ce>  have confirmed the integrity of the Mages Guild
<ce>  and saved us all a monumental trouble!
<ce>  Have your gold and this reward.

Message:  1042
<ce>  So _nec_ confessed to the crime of
<ce>  necromancy? So be it. I will inform the town guard
<ce>  immediately before he can start to doubt you.
<ce>  Splendid work, %pct.

Message: 1043
<ce>  Your knowledge of Mysticism magic surprises your foe.
<ce>  You quickly utter a cantrip, and the hostile spirits he
<ce>  intended to invoke against you dissipate.
<ce>  _nec_, due to his transformation,
<ce>  is held in a momentary stupor by your spell.

Message:  1099
<ce>  "I see. Well, I hope you find what you're looking for.
<ce>  Good evening."
<ce>  
<ce>  _nec_ clearly distrusts you. You can do nothing more.
