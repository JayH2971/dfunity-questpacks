QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> There's an unusual number of requests regarding
<ce> the undead this season. One available task is
<ce> to go to ___res_ and calm a
<ce> restless spirit in _res_.
<ce> Are you in the mood for it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Feeling a bit more adventurous then?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> We have been specifically asked not
<ce> to dispel the spirit by any means.
<ce> If you harm it, you will answer to me.
<ce> Get as close as you comfortably can
<ce> and activate this _holy_.
<ce> This normally wouldn't work, but the
<ce> patron making the request has informed
<ce> us of particular circumstances that
<ce> raise the possibility of a pacification.
<ce> Once this is done, return the _holy_
<ce> to me and report on the matter.
<ce> I will see you here in =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> _qgiver_ wanted a report on
<ce> the ghost of ___res_ by today.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Was it so simple? Good work, %pct.
<ce> I'll take the _holy_ back now.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I think a zombie or a mummy started walking around _res_ in ___res_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
They say Lysandus showed up over in ___res_ and fought someone from a temple.

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
Sometimes I wonder if you're really cut out for this.
<--->
I haven't forgotten about the ghost of ___res_.

Message: 1020
<ce> The spirit's face contorts in agony.
<ce> It emits indistinct whispers incapable
<ce> of forming coherent statements.

Message: 1021
<ce> The _holy_ begins to glow softly, and the
<ce> ghost's movements slow. Its features soften,
<ce> and soon it hovers in tranquility.
<ce> _qgiver_ will want to know of this.

Message: 1022
<ce> You have slain the ghost of ___res_.
<ce> This action reflects poorly on the temple.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of ___qgiver_
 has tasked me with pacifying a restless
 spirit in _res_ at ___res_.
 A _holy_ I have been given will
 do the work for me. I should get
 as close as I can and activate it.
 I have =timer_ days to return to
 report on the matter.
