QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>         One of the family's got a rather vindictive enemy in
<ce>               %crn's courts. This noble's been hauling
<ce>        the fellow to jail every few months for petty crimes.
<ce>           We need someone to help bribe the problem away.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               Someone's gonna come around and do this.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>           Word has it the noble's right hand mutt, _kni_,
<ce>       has a soft spot for precious stones. We've been watching
<ce>          a particular shipment of a flawless kind of _gem_
<ce>         that should catch %g3 attention. Grab a sample from
<ce>                    _jewel_ in ___jewel_ and then
<ce>                get it to _kni_. Lives in ___knitown_.
<ce>        Do it at night when %g1's not working and there won't
<ce>               be as many witnesses. I'll have =reward_
<ce>             gold for you if you're here in =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 You were to deliver the stolen _gem_
<ce>                  and report to _questgiver_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Tell me, how'd _kni_ react?
<ce>      I figured %g1'd put up a show. Nice work. Take the money.

Message:  1011
<ce>        "Thief! I'm so sick of you lot! I'll kill you myself!"

Message:  1012
<ce>          You deftly put the gem away. No one is the wiser.

Message:  1013
<ce> "Good evening. I fail to recognize your face. State your business."

Message:  1014
<ce>        "My word, what an atrocious proposal you make. You say
<ce>        I ought to let your friend go and present me with this
<ce>          _gem_ in exchange? Tell me, have you a good reason
<ce>             behind this blatant perversion of justice?"

Message:  1015
<ce>               "Preposterous. And what might that be?"
<ce>
<ce>        You explain that the guild member is suffering from a
<ce>    vindictive noble's wrath rather than the weight of any crime.
<ce>
<ce>    "That is quite difficult for me to believe. Our justice system
<ce>       is impeccable, and every accusation by our fair monarchy
<ce>            must be well-founded. Don't you believe that?"

Message:  1016
<ce>      "Ha! I should call the town guard on you for trespassing.
<ce>        I never once gave you permission to enter. But lest I
<ce>          be called uncivilized, I will permit you to leave
<ce>                  without further issue. Good day."
<ce>
<ce>                _kni_ extends %g3 hand to shake yours.
<ce>                           Will you do so?

Message:  1017
<ce>  Still holding the _gem_, you take %g3 hand and make the transfer.
<ce>                   _kni_ nods knowingly and winks.
<ce>             Your fellow guild member will soon be free.

Message:  1018
<ce>                   "As I thought. Begone, chattel!"

Message:  1019
<ce> "Indeed, and I would be a fool to consort any further with you. Begone."

Message:  1020
<ce>               _kni_ frowns and reaches %g3 hand back.
<ce>      It appears your fellow guild member will not be set free.

%qdt:
 I'm being sent to ___jewel_ to get a
 particular _gem_ from _jewel_,
 which I need to give to some servant
 named _kni_ who lives in ___knitown_.
 I'll get paid =reward_ gold if I'm back
 to the Thieves Guild in ___questgiver_
 in =timer_ days. If I don't find
 the servant at home, I should wait
 'til night.
