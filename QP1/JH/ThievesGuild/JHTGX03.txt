<ce> Isn't this the easiest money you've ever made?
<ce> One of my more squeamish associates over in
<ce> ___res_ knew you were going. Poor fool only got
<ce> about 200 gold to do the killing. The real
<ce> money comes from doing real work. Take it.

RumorsDuringQuest: [1005]
They say The Crow's showing up in the Bay again. I think it's an impostor.
<--->
Y'hear about The Crow showing up in some town? Probably lies.
<--->
They say The Crow's around, but I thought he died awhile ago.

<ce> Well, since you passed the test, it's time to get you
<ce> involved in the real meat of this business. Can't
<ce> keep babying you around forever, you know. You've had
<ce> help so far, but now you've got to stand on your
<ce> own two feet. Take this bag. Get to ___res_.
<ce> Right before you get there, someone's gonna kill
<ce> another person in _res_. When you
<ce> get there, hurry up and pick out the heart, the
<ce> liver, and the eyes. Put 'em in the bag and
<ce> dump the white powder that's inside one of its
<ce> pouches onto the organs. That's the preserving agent.
<ce> Then you've got about 5 seconds to get it closed before
<ce> it'll start reacting badly to the open air.
<ce> Do all that fast and it'll stay good for months.
<ce> I'll be at ___crowhome_ after. Find me in
<ce> _crowhome_. I'll have =reward_ gold there.

%qdt:
 "The Crow" has taught me how
 to take apart a corpse in
 _res_ at ___res_
 and extract the vital parts
 his employers have asked for.
 I'll be getting =reward_ gold
 from him at ___crowhome_, where he's
 staying in _crowhome_.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 I have taken the parts from the
 body and put them into the bag.

Message:  1070
<ce> Just as _crow_ promised, this
<ce> corpse is very recent, probably
<ce> no older than a few hours.
<ce> You follow his instructions and
<ce> take out the eyes, liver, and heart,
<ce> putting them into the bag and
<ce> sprinkling the powder on top.
<ce> You then seal it closed.

Message:  1080
<ce> Do you wish to leave behind the _lode_
<ce> and give up your ties to _crow_?

Message:  1081
<ce> You discard the small piece of metal.
<ce> Whatever schemes he has are his alone now.

Message:  1082
<ce> You return the _lode_ to your
<ce> belongings, at least for now.
