<ce>          Hail, %ra. For several weeks I have
<ce>           run a contest with my patrons, testing their
<ce>          knowledge concerning royalty among the
<ce>           Iliac Bay. If you're up for the challenge, I
<ce>              could offer you =reward_ gold. Might
<ce>                      you be the first winner?
