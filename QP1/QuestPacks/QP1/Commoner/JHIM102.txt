<ce>          Hail, %ra. You look like you've seen some adventures.
<ce>          I'm retired from all that, but once in a while I still
<ce>             reminisce about the good old days. What say I
<ce>             test some of your knowledge, see if you know
<ce>               as much as I do about surviving in the Iliac Bay?
<ce>           For five questions you can win =reward_ gold pieces.
