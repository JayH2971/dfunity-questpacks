QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>               My name is _questgiver_. I recently made
<ce>            the mistake of desecrating a sorceror's grave
<ce>                 within ___dung_, and I must now pay
<ce>          the price. I seek a champion to guide me into its
<ce>           depths once more, that I might break this curse.
<ce>               Will you protect me in my journey, %ra?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     Then leave me to my misery,
<ce>                    lest the curse strike you too.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      Thank you, %pcn. I have my
<ce>          things packed now, and we will leave immediately.
<ce>        I did not tell you that the curse will cause skeletal
<ce>           apparitions to rise against us every few hours,
<ce>         as I can tell that such presents no great difficulty
<ce>          for one such as yourself. The same cannot be said
<ce>        for my family, who also suffer. I must hasten to free
<ce>           them from it. %god be with us. We will find the
<ce>             _relig_ on the floor therein, which you must
<ce>       take into your hands. We will speak again at that time.
<ce>       Let my family be free within =timer_ days, my guardian.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>        "We agreed to have this finished within =timer_ days.
<ce>          Each passing day puts my family in further danger.
<ce>          I must finish this myself and waste no more time."
<ce>
<ce>                         _questgiver_ departs
<ce>                       without further comment.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   The curse is now over. You feel
<ce>                satisfaction as you take your reward.

<ce>                  "Thank you, %ra. With that _relig_
<ce>                removed, the curse is now almost over.
<ce>              It will nevertheless require one more act.
<ce>             I must satisfy the warlock's vengeance with
<ce>               my own life. Please do this quickly and
<ce>               painlessly. You can collect your payment
<ce>                   from my pockets once I am dead."
<ce>
<ce>                      _questgiver_ kneels on the
<ce>                floor, eyes closed. Will you slay %g2?

Message:  1011
<ce>                "Then I will find some savage creature
<ce>              to do it for me. I thank you for bringing
<ce>               me thus far, even if you could not bear
<ce>                   to kill me. %god watch over you
<ce>                      as you leave this place."
<ce>
<ce>                      _questgiver_ sighs heavily
<ce>                    and hurries into the darkness.

Message:  1012
<ce>                    You hear an agonizing scream.
<ce>                       It appears the curse has
<ce>                        taken care of itself.

Message:  1013
<ce>               "Thank you, %ra. If you meet my family,
<ce>                 tell them you were our savior. They
<ce>                    will want to know your name."
<ce>
<ce>                 You finish it with one swift strike.

Message:  1020
<ce>                  "Thank you, %ra. With this _relig_
<ce>               recovered, the curse is now over. I will
<ce>                find my way out with the path you have
<ce>                 cleared. Please take this money and
<ce>                         my deep gratitude."
<ce>
<ce>                        _questgiver_ takes out
<ce>                   a sack of gold and tosses it to
<ce>                      you, waving as %g1 leaves.
