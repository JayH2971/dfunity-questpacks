QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>          %ra, I need help, and quickly. For the past several
<ce>          nights I have suffered dreams of a terrifying sort, all
<ce>          related to a coven of witches I believe I offended
<ce>          a fortnight ago. In these dreams I see myself being
<ce>          carried away into death by spirits of the world beyond.
<ce>          Please help me right my wrong, that perhaps I may
<ce>          be spared of this offense I have committed.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          Then I must soon write my will, if only to distract me.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>          Then let us hurry. I desire to speak to one member of
<ce>          the coven, _wit1_, who at least tolerates my presence.
<ce>          Please take me to ___loc1_ to see her. If I have
<ce>          any hope of averting disaster, it will be through speaking
<ce>          to her. I will give you everything I have if we can hurry
<ce>          about this without delay. I am ready to go now.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>          _questgiver_ gurgles and slumps down on the ground.
<ce>          The witches' death curse has come to pass.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>          The witch silently puts the _organs_ into a rough
<ce>          hide bag behind her. Then she begins muttering an incantation
<ce>          that begins slowly and increases in speed and fury. She stops
<ce>          after about fifteen seconds and looks away. The burden taken
<ce>          from _questgiver_ is palpable. He speaks to you.
<ce>          
<ce>          "%pcf, I owe my life to you. I will publish it all
<ce>          across ___questgiver_ for the next five years,
<ce>          you are truly an honorable %ra! Take all the gold
<ce>          I saved for this journey, and my blessing."

QuestorPostSuccess:   [1008]
My savior! I live because of you!
<--->
Never again will I trifle with witches! I owe you my life!

Message:  1010
<ce>       Ah, the fool _questgiver_. Tell me, what hast
<ce>       thou come to accuse us of this time? Or will it be
<ce>       mere thievery? Do not believe we take lightly the
<ce>       "borrowing" of a fresh Daedra heart or _organs_,
<ce>       and certainly not when prepared for ritual. If thou hast
<ce>       a finger's length of sincerity within that walking corpse
<ce>       of thine, flee thou to ___loc2_. Our dear sister
<ce>       _wit2_ has wept under the moonlight for the
<ce>       cruelty thou hast shown for far too long. The curse which
<ce>       thou carriest will be delayed for a span, that thou
<ce>       mayest prove thy sincerity. Now be gone, sick cur.

Message:  1011
<ce>       Oh, pathetic _questgiver_. We should have
<ce>       sooner made thee crawl like a dog after what thou
<ce>       didst to us. Thou shalt earn thy penitence, though
<ce>       it leave thee inches from death as it pleases us.
<ce>       Be thou moved to ___apoc_, that thou
<ce>       mayest restore unto us for the _organs_ thou
<ce>       didst steal. An adequate specimen lies within
<ce>       _apoc_. We will forgive thee the Daedra heart,
<ce>       and thou shalt tell all ____apoc_ of the kindness
<ce>       and mercy of these dear sisters. Now move thy
<ce>       feet and bring the _organs_ to me with haste,
<ce>       lest death find thee at its leisure.

Message:  1012
<ce>       _questgiver_ whispers to you with joy.
<ce>       
<ce>       "Here it is! Let us take this to ___loc2_! Hurry!"
