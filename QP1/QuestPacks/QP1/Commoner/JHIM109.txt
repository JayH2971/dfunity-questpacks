<ce>  Hey, some friends and I are doing a sort of
<ce>  birthday celebration for a buddy of ours,
<ce>  and we need someone on the outside.
<ce>  We'll pay you =reward_ gold for helping us.
<ce>  No fighting or danger, we promise.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  %oth. Well, good luck to you.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  All right, so here's the plan. We're doing this
<ce>  sort of mock abduction thing. You're gonna
<ce>  pretend to kidnap him and take him all the
<ce>  way to ___dung_, where we'll
<ce>  meet you and give him the birthday surprise.
<ce>  We've got someone over at his house to tell us
<ce>  when you arrive and leave, so we won't be too
<ce>  far behind. We also let the town guard know,
<ce>  and they're okay with it for now. Our buddy's
<ce>  name is _friend_. He'll be
<ce>  at _res_ tonight after 8.
<ce>  Make sure you get him tonight.
<ce>  Cover his head with this bag and get
<ce>  him moving. See you on the other side.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  You've taken too long. _questgiver_,
<ce>  who was following from afar off with friends,
<ce>  take _friend_ and spoil the
<ce>  surprise out of fear that you've taken it
<ce>  too far. You receive no payment.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  _friend_ moans fearfully.
<ce>  You wonder how long this charade will go on.
<ce>  
<ce>  Then you hear many voices shout, "SURPRISE!"
<ce>  
<ce>  A crowd of his friends surround him, undo his
<ce>  bands, and laugh about the great time they
<ce>  had planning it. You receive opulent praise for
<ce>  your performance in the act. As everyone heads
<ce>  outside, _questgiver_ hands you
<ce>  the promised reward and thanks you.

QuestorPostSuccess:   [1008]
You can keep a secret. That's good.

Message:  1010
<ce>  Yes, I'm _friend_.
<ce>  How can I help you?

Message:  1011
<ce>  You cover _friend_'s head with
<ce>  the cloth sack and begin to drag him around.
<ce>  He yells for help but no one intervenes.
<ce>  Whether they're all in on it or are actually
<ce>  terrified of you is yet to be seen.
