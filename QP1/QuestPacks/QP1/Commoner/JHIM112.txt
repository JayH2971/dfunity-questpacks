<ce>                   Hail, %ra. Do you have a minute?
<ce>             I was cleaning house recently and found this
<ce>             _item_ with some fairly old runes etched on
<ce>              the side. I'm not brave enough to test it
<ce>                  myself. I was wondering, are you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              Someone's gotta come around and try this.

<ce>             "Oh good! Thank you. Take it in your hands.
<ce>          I think that if you put your hands underneath and
<ce>           twist it to the right you should be able to..."
<ce>
<ce>            Before _qgiver_ can finish speaking, the frail
<ce>                 artifact breaks apart in your hands.

<ce>           My word, %ra, I've been worried sick since I saw
<ce>          you warp off into the great unknown. Where did it
<ce>            send you? How did you get out? Oh, how awful.
<ce>        Thank you for setting my mind at ease on both counts.
<ce>          If it helps, I have this money set aside for you.
<ce>                 I hope it compensates your trouble.

QuestorPostSuccess:   [1008]
No more dusty trinkets for me! And hopefully for you.

<ce>        The _item_ has already crumbled to pieces. All you can
<ce>          do now is to get out alive and return to _qgiver_.
<ce>
<ce>  (Hint: You may be in a location that's impossible to escape from,)
<ce>               (like at the bottom of a chute. If so,)
<ce>   (make a save and try the console command "teleport" to get out.)

%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of ___qgiver_
 asked me to test a runed _item_,
 which teleported me into some labyrinth.
 I should ask for compensation once I return.
