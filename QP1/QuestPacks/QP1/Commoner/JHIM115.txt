<ce>                Quiet down. I've got a lead on a house
<ce>                 in town that's gonna be holding some
<ce>                 big money overnight. I can tell you
<ce>                    where but it's gonna cost you.
<ce>                           Wanna find out?

<ce>            It's gonna be 400 gold. It's worth it though.
<ce>          Talk to me in a sec, I gotta get my money bag out.

<ce>                         thank you very much.
<ce>
<ce>                  So here's the deal. _res_ here in
<ce>              town's gonna be storing some money from an
<ce>                 estate sale. I didn't hear how much
<ce>                   but it's a couple thou' I think.
<ce>                 Go in after midnight. If you try it
<ce>              during the day they're gonna go ballistic
<ce>             on ya. Their courier's gonna show up to take
<ce>             the money after midnight so if ya wanna fake
<ce>            it, that's your cover. Whatever happens after
<ce>               that is your show. Nice doing business.

<ce>              You enter the residence and quietly close
<ce>                         the door behind you.

<ce>                      "Excuse me? Who are you?"
<ce>
<ce>         A startled youth looks at you from around a corner.
<ce>              Do you say you're here to take the money?

<ce>                Your purchased knowledge was correct.
<ce>               They are indeed guarding the house until
<ce>             midnight. You have arrived at the wrong time
<ce>                   and been identified as a threat.
