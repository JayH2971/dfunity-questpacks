<ce>  (Yawn) ... I feel awfully bored.
<ce> If you're looking for something to do,
<ce> I could test your memory with a fable
<ce> of a sort, see how well you can remember
<ce> it. I'll pay you if you answer it all
<ce> right. Want to give it a try?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Nothing lost by asking.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  Well then, here goes.
<ce>
<ce>  The great prince _prince_ called forth
<ce>  his Nord servant, who bore a recently washed
<ce>  longsword, to practice fencing. An Argonian who saw
<ce>  them stood by to admire their expertise. He wished
<ce>  to be so skilled at long blades, but he only
<ce>  knew to wield knives. The Argonian went to the
<ce>  Temple of Akatosh to pursue training with
<ce>  a katana he had purchased from a pawnbroker,
<ce>  but his belief in Arkay was an abomination
<ce>  to them, and he was rejected. He left 200 gold
<ce>  in their coffers to try to change their mind
<ce>  but their demeanors stayed harsh as ever.
<ce>  In despair at the treatment he received, the
<ce>  Argonian returned to the field where he saw
<ce>  the prince _prince_ practicing and found
<ce>  him laying in the grass with a severe wound.
<ce>  He lept over the fence to bandage up the
<ce>  wounded man. The Nord came out from hiding and
<ce>  stabbed the Argonian with a poisoned claymore,
<ce>  nestling the pommel in the prince's palm.
<ce>  He then took the paralyzed Argonian's hand
<ce>  and placed a poisoned tanto in it. Having
<ce>  framed the lizard, he took the Prince's
<ce>  inheritance and rode off to his own country.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>   Nope. It's a good one, isn't it?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  Hey, not bad %ra. Take this money.
