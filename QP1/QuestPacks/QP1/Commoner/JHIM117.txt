QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  Hey %ra, do you think the King of Worms
<ce>  is real? And would you be willing to take
<ce>  some fool like me to meet him for money?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  Yeah? Go jump in a lake then.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  Oh yeah! I told my buddies this would happen!
<ce>  %oth, I'm excited. I've got =reward_ gold here
<ce>  for you when we meet him. They say the place
<ce>  is called Scourg Barrow, in the Dragontail
<ce>  Mountains. I can't believe I'm gonna meet
<ce>  the King of Worms face to face! Boy howdy!
<ce>  You do know how to get there, right? If not,
<ce>  ya wanna ask people around town. Maybe one
<ce>  of them's gonna know. I sure don't.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  "Hey, to be honest, I don't know if you
<ce>  know what you're doing. I'm gonna give you
<ce>  these =lesser_ gold coins for travel
<ce>  expenses, but I've got to get moving on."
<ce>  
<ce>  _questgiver_ departs.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  _questgiver_, not entirely sure
<ce>  what to do, shouts for joy and then bows
<ce>  down to worship the King of Worms.
<ce>  The shrouded figure stares and smirks
<ce>  at your employer's antics. He then
<ce>  reaches his hand toward %g2.
<ce>  Before %g1 can get up, he speaks.
<ce>  
<ce>  "No, that position is perfect. Hold still."
<ce>  
<ce>  A burst of light enshrouds _questgiver_,
<ce>  and %g3 body is consumed instantly. You only
<ce>  find %g3 clothes and the few effects %g1
<ce>  brought to this journey, among them
<ce>  the gold you were promised. You take what
<ce>  belongs to you. The King of Worms says,
<ce>  
<ce>  "I would normally loathe such an interruption,
<ce>  but I can make use of occasional sacrifices.
<ce>  Go with my esteem, %ra."

Scourg Barrow? That's an empty castle in the Dragontail Mountains, ain't it?
<--->
Ya wanna get to Scourg Barrow? Just a tourist trap.
<--->
Scourg Barrow? Go to Bleeding Soul of Arkay in the Dragontail Mountains. Head straight south. It's a long walk.
<--->
Ha ha ha! You got a death wish, %ra? Don't go there!
<--->
They say it's below Vartom Court and above Makehda. No idea about the longitude.

 _questgiver_ of
 ___questgiver_, ____questgiver_
 has hired me to guide %g2 to Scourg
 Barrow to meet the King of Worms.
 I will be paid =reward_ gold for doing so.
 Though %g1 doesn't know where it is,
 I can ask other townspeople whether they
 know of its location.
