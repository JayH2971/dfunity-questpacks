QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                    Hail friend, name's _qgiver_.
<ce>              Got a business offer for ya, my good %ra.
<ce>              Did you know centaurs are exceedingly rare
<ce>           across Tamriel? There's big money to be made by
<ce>             capturing and selling them. If you want in,
<ce>               I know the perfect place to find a few.
<ce>                     I can pay you =reward_ gold.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               Ha. There's no law against it, you know.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               All right then, let's get moving to it.
<ce>                       Place's called ___dung_.
<ce>              I'll show it to you on that map of yours.
<ce>                You keep me safe and let me do my work
<ce>             in there. With a few good foals we'll be set
<ce>               mate! You won't regret this, not at all!
<ce>               But can we be finished by =timer_ days?
<ce>                  I'm a busy person, don't you know.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>              "You've taken far too long and I will not
<ce>         pay you! I'll find help taming centaurs elsewhere!"

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Free from the risk of centaur attack,
<ce>                       _qgiver_ turns and bows.
<ce>
<ce>           "You're quite good at this! Maybe I'll look for
<ce>          you again some time. There's good money to be made
<ce>            if you're dependable, %ra. Take your gold and
<ce>              my best wishes. Come along now creatures!"
<ce>
<ce>                    Then %g1 leads the foals away.

QuestorPostSuccess:   [1008]
Those centaurs sold quite well. We could make a good business of this.

Message:  1010
<ce>              _qgiver_ whispers, "All right, this is how
<ce>    it's going to work. I'm going to call out for these creatures,
<ce>          and you'll slay the adults that'll try to stop us.
<ce>      Once I find a few good colts I'll lasso them up and we'll
<ce>               get out of here. Keep your eyes peeled!"

Message:  1011
<ce>              Unbeknownst to you, _qgiver_ has cornered
<ce>        a pair of young centaurs and gotten ropes around their
<ce>        necks. The process is far more benign than it sounds.
<ce>            Using %g3 centaur call, %g1 calms them enough
<ce>                        to get them to follow.
<ce>
<ce>             "Well then, this is looking quite positive.
<ce>      Let's make our getaway, before we attract more attention."

Message:  1012
<ce>                            "No! Oh, no!"
<ce>
<ce>                _qgiver_ has gotten separated from you
<ce>            by a short distance, which was enough to let a
<ce>           raging centaur near. The creature ends %g3 life
<ce>             and turns to you, furious at your intrusion.

Message:  1013
<ce>         With the centaur dead, you check _qgiver_'s corpse.
<ce>          You find the money with which %g1 intended to pay
<ce>             you and little else. You recover it. Without
<ce>            %g3 calling, the centaurs here should be much
<ce>                             more docile.
