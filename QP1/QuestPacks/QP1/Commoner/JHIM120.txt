QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                    I am _questgiver_, and I need
<ce>                  an escort. I seem to have taken an
<ce>               illness no one can cure. Can you help me
<ce>                get to ___temple_ to see one of %crn's
<ce>                      experts? I must be cured.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    Then I must travel on my own.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  I need to see _curer_ at _temple_,
<ce>           who they tell me is head and shoulders above the
<ce>            rest. I've tried every cure under the sun and
<ce>        nothing works. I need help, quickly. Please get me to
<ce>                 %g2 and I'll pay you =reward_ gold.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>              "My patience has its limits, and you have
<ce>            exceeded them. I will find _curer_ on my own."
<ce>
<ce>                        _questgiver_ departs.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            _questgiver_'s money is yours for the taking.

Message:  1010
<ce>                     "Hello, how can I help you?"
<ce>
<ce>                 _questgiver_ gives an explanation of
<ce>               the symptoms from the last several days.
<ce>               _curer_ listens intently, showing signs
<ce>         of concern, and then asks to conduct a more thorough
<ce>               examination. After casting a few spells,
<ce>                       %g1 jumps back in alarm.
<ce>
<ce>        "What have you done? Who have you offended? These are
<ce>       no ordinary wounds. You carry an illness of the Daedra!"
<ce>
<ce>                    _questgiver_ looks ashamed and
<ce>                  asks how much the cure will cost.

Message:  1011
<ce>    "There is no cure! Within a few days you'll become contagious,
<ce>             and infect everyone you touch with the same.
<ce>                     The plague will cover %crn!
<ce>            You are now a mere vessel of the Daedric will,
<ce>          and thousands will suffer at your hands! The only
<ce>          cure for one of your kind is death. And were I not
<ce>         sworn to heal, I would administer that death to you
<ce>                    this instant without remorse."
<ce>
<ce>               _curer_ looks at you expectantly, hoping
<ce>        you will be brave enough to take _questgiver_'s life.
<ce>                   For %g3 part, %g1 begins to beg.
<ce>
<ce>      "No, no, this is all out of proportion. You can't kill me!
<ce>                     I know! We'll do something!
<ce>         I'll go flee off into the wilderness and never speak
<ce>      to another sentient being again! I'll live off rabbits and
<ce>      fruits! I'll keep away from every civilization in Tamriel!
<ce>                    Please, just give me my life!"
<ce>
<ce>            The decision appears to be in your hands now.
<ce>          Will you slay _questgiver_ to end the plague here?

Message:  1012
<ce>                    _questgiver_ howls in despair,
<ce>                  attempting to fight for %g3 life.

Message:  1013
<ce>                 _questgiver_ begins to weep for the
<ce>         mercy you've shown. Saying nothing else, %g1 throws
<ce>           the promised money at you and flees the temple.
<ce>                        _curer_ glares at you.
<ce>
<ce>        "Do you actually think that fool will follow through?
<ce>         You may have doomed countless lives. I will hold you
<ce>               responsible before the %rt if this leads
<ce>                        to an outbreak, %ra."

Message:  1014
Needin' a cure? Ain't nobody better than _curer_.
<--->
Wow, lookin' a little sick there, am I right? Better find a temple fast.

Message:  1015
<ce>                 _curer_ stands in respectful silence
<ce>                       for _questgiver_'s life,
<ce>                           and then speaks.
<ce>
<ce>         "You think it's easy for me to tell a person to die?
<ce>   My heart aches. Such is the burden I carry in this line of work.
<ce>           Thank you for carrying out such a grievous act."
