<ce>              I have suffered a grievous wrong, and the
<ce>         law gives me no justice. Join me and right my wrong.
<ce>                   You will be paid for your help.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                               Begone.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Then let us go deliver justice.
<ce>                  We will find this man, _fool_, in
<ce>                  _res_ in this city. Lead the way.

<ce>                   "I will deliver justice myself!
<ce>                       You take far too long."
<ce>
<ce>                      _questgiver_ hurries off.

<ce>                         What's done is done.

<ce>                _fool_ cowers at the sight of you two.
<ce>             There is no question what you have come for.
<ce>                        _questgiver_ bellows.
<ce>
<ce>           " =num_ years married, and no one has ever dared
<ce>          approach my beloved! And now you have sullied her!
<ce>                Where the law fails, we will deliver!"
<ce>
<ce>                 _fool_ cries out, "I know my wrong!
<ce>           Please, let us work something out! I have mended
<ce>                   my ways! Just give me my life!"

Message:  1011
<ce>              Cold rage overtakes _questgiver_'s visage.
<ce>
<ce>            "What you have stolen, no one can ever return.
<ce>                            You will die!"
<ce>
<ce>               _fool_ starts to weep, grabbing a weapon
<ce>                 to attempt self-defense. Do you help
<ce>                      _questgiver_ kill _fool_?

Message:  1012
<ce>                     _questgiver_ roars in fury,
<ce>                      and the battle commences.

Message:  1013
<ce>                   _questgiver_ thanks you for your
<ce>                help, but looks no better than before.
<ce>
<ce>            "I thought this would satisfy me. It does not.
<ce>                 I will not rest until I find peace."
<ce>
<ce>         After handing you the promised payment, %g1 departs.

Message:  1014
<ce>                     _questgiver_ roars in fury,
<ce>           unwilling to listen. You have become %g3 enemy,
<ce>               just like _fool_. You and he prepare to
<ce>                 defend yourselves from _questgiver_.

Message:  1015
<ce>                  _fool_ weeps terribly at the sight
<ce>                     of _questgiver_'s dead body.
<ce>           This experience has shaken everyone up terribly.
<ce>
<ce>            "I knew %g2 distantly as another resident here
<ce>              in ___questgiver_, but never thought this
<ce>      could come of %g2. How could one be so distorted by hate?"
<ce>
<ce>                 _fool_ takes some more time to weep.
<ce>             Soon he opens up a nearby box and hands you
<ce>            a ring, unable to express his thanks in words.
<ce>               He waves you away to commiserate alone.

Message:  1016
<ce>               You decide to have no part of this feud.
<ce>        Whatever the outcome will be, it will not involve you.

Message:  1017
<ce>        It appears you're the only one left standing from this
<ce>              madness. You locate the money _questgiver_
<ce>                            promised you.

%qdt:
 _questgiver_ will pay me =reward_ gold to
 help %g2 get vengeance on someone named
 _fool_ in ___questgiver_.
 The tension in the air tells me we shouldn't
 take more than a day to do so.
