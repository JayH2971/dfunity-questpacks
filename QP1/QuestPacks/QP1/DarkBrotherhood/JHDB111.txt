QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>        Have you ever heard of an Archmagister, %pct?
<ce>  It is the highest known public office of the Mages Guild.
<ce>  Whether there is one Archmagister or many is beyond
<ce>  my concern; we have a demand here for his culling,
<ce>   with a powerful enchanted _reward_ as a reward.
<ce>  Would you like to wield it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>   We should screen our initiates for Mages Guild membership.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>      This Archmagister, whoever he is, is conducting
<ce>  a visit to the guild hall in ___mg_.
<ce>  Look for someone under the alias "_archm_."
<ce>  For this contract, you must eschew all subtlety.
<ce>  Go boldly in the name of Mephala and slay him.
<ce>  Whoever else stands in your way does so at their own peril.
<ce>  Your license to kill is absolute.
<ce>  
<ce>  Return here within =timer_ days,
<ce>  and your _reward_ will await you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>    Your time to claim the reward for the Archmagister's death has passed.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>        It must have been quite a battle,
<ce>  from the rumors the Spymaster's been getting.
<ce>  All the more glory to the Night Mother.
<ce>  No one is exempt from the Brotherhood's reach.
<ce>  No one.
<ce>  
<ce>  I hope you enjoy this.

Message:  1011
<ce>  "Yes? Can I help you?"
<ce>  
<ce>  Subtlety would make this a lot easier,
<ce>  but you have no such option today.
<ce>  You inform him that this
<ce>  is the day of his death.
<ce>  He shouts loud and fearfully.
<ce>  
<ce>  "The Dark Brotherhood is in our halls!
<ce>  Everyone, defend yourselves!!"

Message:  1012
<ce>  "This-- this cannot be!! No!"
<ce>
