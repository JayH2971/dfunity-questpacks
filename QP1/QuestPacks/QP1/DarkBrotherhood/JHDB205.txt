<ce>               %pct, tell me concerning yourself. Were
<ce>          you to spend a night in a tavern after a long day
<ce>           of merchandising, only to be awakened every six
<ce>          minutes by a loud and drunk barbarian in the main
<ce>            hall, would you feel it proper to approach the
<ce>           Brotherhood and request some natural justice be
<ce>           meted out against the clueless brute? And would
<ce>              you answer a call to deliver such justice?
                                     <--->
<ce>           %pct, I will not mince words. You, I, and every
<ce>                   other person in ___qgiver_ hates
<ce>              barbarians. We have a petition to rid %crn
<ce>            of one of them. Will you take advantage of it?

<ce>            The Brotherhood rarely makes mistakes, and we
<ce>             hope for your sake you are not one of them.

<ce>           The only correct answer. This barbarian, staying
<ce>           in _tavern_, is actually the target of multiple
<ce>          contracts. If only every day were as lucrative as
<ce>            this. The motives include ceaselessly bragging
<ce>               about romantic conquests, debauching the
<ce>          soon-to-be-married, shouting loudly in the morning
<ce>         hours, and even scratching a beer glass. Apparently
<ce>          the innkeeper has also grown tired of this beast.
<ce>                   Serve ___qgiver_ by slaying this
<ce>            brute and returning here within twelve hours.

<ce>                 Good, %pct. But let this task cause
<ce>                   you no pride. You have yet to do
<ce>                meaningful service in Mephala's favor.

<ce>                 Ha ha ha! Sorry %ra, I'm havin' too
<ce>                much fun 'ere! Maybe a good thrashing
<ce>                 will get some o' the beer outta me!

<ce>                   Ha ha ha! This's rich! This %ra
<ce>               is tryin' ta start a fight! Hey fellas,
<ce>                 get on over here an' even tha odds!

<ce>                "But how many more... could I have..."
<ce>
<ce>                    The fool's mouth shuts before
<ce>                     more stupidity can flow out.
<ce>                       Your work here is done.
