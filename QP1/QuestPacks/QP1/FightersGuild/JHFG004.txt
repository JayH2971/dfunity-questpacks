<ce>               I've got another kind of job here, %pcf,
<ce>           in case you're tired of killing rats and bears.
<ce>            There's this house here in town that's afraid
<ce>             of a break-in tonight and they need a guard.
<ce>         It's paying =reward_ gold. Is that your kind of job?
                                     <--->
<ce>                   We got a client who needs _res_
<ce>           to get watched over tonight. Pretty simple job.
<ce>         Just get there by 11:00 tonight and stay there 'til
<ce>      sunlight. It's worth =reward_ gold. Wanna give it a shot?

<ce>                 I hope I find someone quick. I don't
<ce>                   want to have to cover this one.

<ce>                All right, good. Head over in town to
<ce>                        _res_. Stay there from
<ce>                11:00 at night to sunup. These people
<ce>               weren't too specific about what threats
<ce>              they were expecting, but it's not gonna be
<ce>              vampires or werewolves or something, just
<ce>              some local low-life and his friends. Stay
<ce>              inside until they say they don't need you
<ce>             any longer. You're contracted for one night.
<ce>             They'll give you the gold when you're done.

<ce>                  You have protected our house, %ra,
<ce>                    and earned your gold. This is
<ce>                   what they said belonged to you.

Here to give us a worse reputation than we've already got, %pcf?

<ce>                      We would have been killed
<ce>                    tonight if it weren't for you!

<ce>              Curiously, you notice nearby a bag of gold
<ce>              which appears to be out of everyone else's
<ce>                sight. The adrenaline rush of today's
<ce>               events may have worn them out too much,
<ce>              lending to momentary distraction. Will you
<ce>                   attempt to take it for yourself?

<ce>
<ce>           This is all too easy for one of your skill set.
<ce>               The bag of money is now yours, adding an
<ce>            additional =stealg_ gold pieces to your count.

<ce>
<ce>           Your movement while grabbing the coin bag is too
<ce>           obvious. Someone peering over sees that you have
<ce>          your hand on property which is clearly not yours.
<ce>              The quiet morning hours are shattered by a
<ce>                             shrill yell.
<ce>
<ce>             "THIEF! The Fighters Guild sent us a thief!
<ce>                            Someone help!"
<ce>
<ce>             Something tells you they will not be paying
<ce>              for your guard service. Perhaps you should
<ce>              work on your thieving skills before trying
<ce>                       to rip off your clients.
