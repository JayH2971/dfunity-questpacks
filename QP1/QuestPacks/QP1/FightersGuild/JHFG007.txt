<ce>                We have a job here that doesn't really
<ce>               fit the bill for what the Fighters Guild
<ce>                 was made for, but it still pays. Do
<ce>                     ya wanna go over to ___res_
<ce>                  and bring some _pick_ someone left
<ce>                over there? Sounds like easy pickin's.
                                     <--->
<ce>                We've got a request here to go over to
<ce>                    ___res_ and pick up something
<ce>                that got left over there by accident.
<ce>                   Sounds simple enough. Wanna take
<ce>                           this one, %pcf?

<ce>           Man, are you just here to smash skulls or what?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 All right, get going then. ___res_,
<ce>                        _res_. You're looking
<ce>                  for some _pick_ that they said is
<ce>               gonna be on the floor. Just grab it and
<ce>                 there should be some instructions on
<ce>                 where you take it. That's what they
<ce>                      told me, at least. _culp_
<ce>               should give you your reward after that.
<ce>               I'm giving you =timer_ days to do this.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                _questgiver_ expected you to return to
<ce>                ___questgiver_ with the _pick_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               This again? %oth. Hey, I'm really sorry
<ce>           about this. We told the %t and everyone's doing
<ce>             everything they can to find who's behind it.
<ce>       But look, I'm not gonna let you walk away empty-handed.
<ce>             Keep that _pick_ you got from them and sell
<ce>           it if you want, and I'll give you =reward_ gold
<ce>               out of my own pocket. It's not that much
<ce>            but it's literally all I've got left over from
<ce>               last week. Just know that we appreciate
<ce>               how there are members like you watching
<ce>                       out for the rest of us.

<ce>                 This month we're paying =bigsum_ for
<ce>                 every Fighters Guild bozo. Remember:
<ce>               priorities are eyes, hearts, and lungs.
<ce>                   Partials mean less pay for you.

%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild has given
 me a task which apparently
 doesn't involve fighting. I'm headed
 to ___res_ to pick up
 some _pick_ inside a building,
 _res_. They'll tell
 me where to take it after that.
 I should be back in ___questgiver_
 in =timer_ or fewer days.

Message:  1031
%qdt:

 tell _questgiver_ about it.
