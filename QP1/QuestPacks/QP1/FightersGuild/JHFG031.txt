<ce>            Some band of rabblerousers stole a kid and are
<ce>                 expecting a ransom from the family.
<ce>           The town guard or some knight usually intervenes
<ce>           in these cases, but the kid's parents can't wait
<ce>              around for some charity case to help out.
<ce>               They're paying money to have their child
<ce>               returned to them. You in on this, %pcf?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 %oth. I hope someone gets this fast.
<ce>                    The guild needs a reputation.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                Let me show you ___dung_ on your map.
<ce>                  Head there, find the kid, get out.
<ce>                Name is _kid_. You can bring %g2 back
<ce>                here and we'll take care of the rest.
<ce>                Make sure you're here in =timer_ days.
<ce>            They have good money on us not taking forever.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               The family expected you to deliver _kid_
<ce>                    to the Fighters Guild by now.
<ce>                       Your reward is forfeit.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  You take the gold they offer you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I have it on really good authority that the %t is a vampire.

Message:  1010
<ce>           "Hi! You look different from the bad people who
<ce>                brought me here. Where are we going?"
<ce>
<ce>            You answer to ____questgiver_, and _kid_ nods.
<ce>               "Yep, that's home! Let's go, I'm ready!"

Message:  1011
<ce>            "By the way, I found this wicked-looking sword
<ce>       down here! It's got ridges in the blade and everything!
<ce>        Do you know anything about swords? Could you teach me
<ce>                          how to swing it?"
<ce>
<ce>            Do you try to teach _kid_ about using a sword?
<ce>
<ce>                (SKILL CHECK: YES: Long Blade, medium)

Message:  1012
<ce>                       (SKILL CHECK SUCCEEDED)
<ce>
<ce>       You carefully show %g2 how to properly hold the pommel,
<ce>               swing the sword, and deliver a full cut.
<ce>            You hope %g3 parents won't criticize the guild
<ce>           for this, but it's a dangerous world out there.
<ce>                 Perhaps if _kid_ knew this already,
<ce>                      you wouldn't be down here.

Message:  1013
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>            With your encouragement, _kid_ starts swinging
<ce>           the blade around wildly. Once %g1 loses a proper
<ce>         posture, %g1 ends up falling onto the blade, slicing
<ce>               %g3 shoulder. You wince and help %g2 up.
<ce>
<ce>         "I guess I'll have to wait 'til I'm older," %g1 says
<ce>              as you apply a makeshift bandage. Then %g1
<ce>                   drops the sword and follows you.

Message:  1014
<ce>        "I guess I'll have to wait 'til I'm older," %g1 says,
<ce>           disappointed. You convince %g2 to drop the sword
<ce>                         and come after you.

Message:  1015
<ce>                     As you breathe in fresh air,
<ce>               you become aware of two figures nearby.
<ce>
<ce>          "Show's over, %ra. Let the kid go or you're dead."
<ce>
<ce>                        You brace for combat.

Message:  1016
<ce>              While their eyes are on you, _kid_ sneaks
<ce>           up behind them and delivers a nasty slice to one
<ce>           of the thugs' legs. He shrieks in pain and drops
<ce>              to one knee, fleeing pitifully. The other,
<ce>         finding himself in an adverse two-on-one situation,
<ce>                      helps his friend run away.
<ce>
<ce>           "THAT WAS AWESOME! I'm gonna be a real fighter!
<ce>              This is the coolest thing I've ever done!"
<ce>      _kid_ dances around, clattering the sword onto the ground.
<ce>           You'll have to see whether %g1 tells %g3 parents
<ce>                           about that part.

Message:  1017
<ce>                  Somewhere in this labyrinth, _kid_
<ce>                         awaits your rescue.

Message:  1018
<ce>           You present the child to _questgiver_, and hear
<ce>                  the parents come down the stairs.
<ce>                They smother _kid_ in hugs and kisses,
<ce>                      happy to see %g2 unharmed.
<ce>            "What a wonderful job the Fighters Guild does!
<ce>           I wonder if they can get rid of those rats we've
<ce>                      been fussing about, too."
<ce>
<ce>        They then turn to you and deliver a large bag of gold.
<ce>          "The best investment we've ever made. Thank you!"
<ce>             The intact family then leaves the building,
<ce>            and _questgiver_ gives you a pat on the back.

Message:  1019
<ce>           You present the child to _questgiver_, and hear
<ce>                  the parents come down the stairs.
<ce>                They smother _kid_ in hugs and kisses,
<ce>             trying to hide their worry at the large gash
<ce>                on %g3 shoulder. Then %g1 blurts out,
<ce>      "Don't worry about my arm. This %ra and I were practicing
<ce>           sword fighting down in the cave, and I got hurt.
<ce>                        But I'm fine, really!"
<ce>
<ce>                 The parents pause and glare at you.
<ce>            They thank you for bringing their child back,
<ce>          and give you a reward, albeit lesser than they had
<ce>                 originally planned. Then they leave
<ce>                     the building, ignoring you.
