QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             Okay, got one here that's dead simple, and 
<ce>   the pay is bad enough to match it. The trainer upstairs
<ce>   is running out of bandages, and we need someone to get some
<ce>   more. Doesn't matter where, just bandages in good shape.
<ce>   You wanna grab this one?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>           I don't blame you. Nobody's gonna get rich doing that.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Okay then, I'm a little surprised. But anyway,
<ce>   it's real simple. Five bandages. General stores, pawn shops,
<ce>   dead bandits, I don't care where they come from. We're gonna
<ce>   run out in two days, so make sure you're back here before then.
<ce>   The pay's lousy like I told you, but it'll get you points with us.
<ce>   Sound worth it? Time will tell, I guess. Stay safe out there.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                _questgiver_ expected you to return to
<ce>                ___questgiver_ with five bandages by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               One two... five, yep, you got it. Nice job.
<ce>     You know, it's little things like this that earn
<ce>     you points. When you're out there massacring daedra
<ce>     and liches, remember this humble little guild hall, and
<ce>     the good you've done us. Anyway, no more babbling.
<ce>     Here's your hard-earned lucre.

Message:  1010
<ce>    You now have five bandages, deliverable to the Fighters Guild.

Message:  1011
<ce>    I don't see five bandages with you, partner. I can't give you the gold without 'em.

__questgiver_ of ___questgiver_ needs five ordinary
bandages before =timer_ days have passed. It doesn't
matter where I get them from as long as they're usable.
I was told I could find some in general stores and pawn shops.
