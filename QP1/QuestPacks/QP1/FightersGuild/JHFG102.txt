<ce>           One of those "open secrets" 'round here
<ce>           is that the Mages Guild uses some of the caves
<ce>           out in the wild for their experiments.
<ce>           Sometimes it's just rogue mages out there,
<ce>           but one or two of those hideouts is
<ce>           actually official territory. Well, they've
<ce>           gone too far and we've got a contract
<ce>           to clean one of them out.
<ce>           If you're not a fan of the Mages Guild,
<ce>           we've got a pretty good Claymore
<ce>           here if you can finish this.

<ce>            I dunno what it is, but nobody wants

<ce>           Good to hear. Head on into ___dung_,
<ce>           %di. It's got atronachs and gargoyles,
<ce>           and you'll have to kill a bunch of 'em
<ce>           before the mages get the hint.
<ce>           I'm not expecting you clean out the whole
<ce>           place, just enough to bring their

<ce>                    Your contract to slay _dummy_
<ce>                        in ___res_ ends today.

<ce>                  Hey, welcome back. Good to see you
<ce>                   in one piece. Here's your pauldron.

The Fighters Guild failed to save some kid from an abandoned prison. Shame on them.

<ce>
<ce>             Your drug-addled foe is in a frenzy, willing
<ce>          to try anything. Up comes a swift roundhouse kick
<ce>      to your face, which anyone more agile might have avoided.
<ce>                           It hurts a lot.

<ce>                     a member of the Mages Guild!"
