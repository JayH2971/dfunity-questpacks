QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>       We try to stay out of politics as much as possible, but
<ce>            sometimes the %t forces our hand. There's some
<ce>                 criminal down in __dungeon_ that the
<ce>            guards have given up on who needs to die. It's
<ce>            paying =reward_ gold. Is that enough for you?
                                     <--->
<ce>             So the Fighters Guild just kills spiders and
<ce>               bears all day, right? Not quite.
<ce>              The %t sometimes tries to get us to pick off some
<ce>               dangerous criminal that they can't catch
<ce>            themselves. It still pays though, in this case
<ce>                =reward_ gold. Does that work for you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    I'm fine with that. What do we
<ce>                   look like? The Dark Brotherhood?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            You just can't resist, can you %pcf? Get down
<ce>                    to __dungeon_ and back here in
<ce>         =timer_ days, and I'll have your _reward_ gold here.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Good work. That should keep the %t
<ce>                      off our backs for awhile.

Message:  1010
<ce>         Wait! Wait, stop! I'm a member of the Thieves Guild!
<ce>       Don't kill me! If you let me go, I promise I'll tell my
<ce>              people good things about you! Let me live!

Message:  1011
<ce>                       Yes! I will spread your
<ce>                  fame among the underworld as if my
<ce>                   life depended on it. Thank you!

<ce>
<ce>           As soon as you enter, you step on a false tile.
<ce>            A disgusting gas begins to shoot into the air.
<ce>       You don't seem to suffer any immediate effects from it,
<ce>            but you wonder what it might have done to you.

Message:  1013
<ce>                 (ATTRIBUTE CHECK PASSED: ENDURANCE)
<ce>
<ce>           As soon as you enter, you step on a false tile.
<ce>            A disgusting gas begins to shoot into the air.
<ce>             Your system is strong enough to fight it off
<ce>        until you reach cleaner air, and you emerge unscathed.

Message:  1020
<ce>                        Your quarry is slain.

 I've been contracted by the %t
 through the Fighters Guild of
 ___qgiver_ to hunt
 down a criminal
 in ___dungeon_. I need to
 be back in =timer_ days to get my =reward_ gold.

Message:  1040
<ce>          No, no, wait! We're going to do this right, okay?
<ce>     I've got a stash of =survivegold_ gold. Sounds pretty good,
<ce>        right? Just let me live and I'll leave it by the exit.
<ce>                We both get what we want, right? Okay?

<ce>                  See, you're one of the smart ones.
<ce>                      Glad we found each other.
<ce>                You just head on out and I'll leave it
<ce>                     outside the entrance, okay?

Message:  1042
<ce>            Sure enough, you find a large sack containing
<ce>                many gold coins outside the entrance.
<ce>               It's a shame the Fighters Guild won't be
<ce>           giving a good report this time, but that's life.

Message:  1045
<ce>         Something strange is happening here. Your foe growls
<ce>               and gnashes about in a truly savage way.

<ce>                   Moron %ra! You thought I wasn't
<ce>                     ready for you? COME ON OUT!

--spawn 4 helpers

Message:  1055
<ce>                Wait, moron. %pcf. %ra working for the
<ce>          Fighters Guild. I know you and a lot more. Listen.
<ce>
<ce>            The reason the %t wants me to die is I've got
<ce>          some very ugly details about an illegitimate heir
<ce>          that's coming of age. I'm headed to ___palace_ to
<ce>            barter for my silence. Join me and split it or
<ce>              kill me and lose it all. Are you with me?

Message:  1056
<ce>         All right. I was going to let them stew for another
<ce>             week but you left me no choice. We're headed
<ce>                 to the palace at ___palace_. Take me
<ce>                to someone named _noble_ and we'll see
<ce>                what %crn's gonna give us. Let's move.

Message:  1057
<ce>             Your partner's suspicions of you have gotten
<ce>                 too strong. After you let your guard
<ce>              down momentarily, you find yourself alone.

Message:  1058
<ce>                 Your partner takes _noble_ aside and
<ce>          whispers something in %g3 ear for about a minute.
<ce>         The noble feigns surprise, clearly in on the secret.
<ce>         With a snap of the fingers %g1 summons a servant who
<ce>        brings several useful objects to the two of you, which
<ce>                you split evenly before parting ways.

Message:  1059
%qdt:
 I've sided with the outlaw I was meant to slay.
 We're headed to ___palace_ to speak
 with a noble named _noble_
 to try to barter about some
 dangerous information.

Message:  1060
<ce>      Curiously, your mark appears to already be dead. You find
<ce>        cuts, deep and wide, across the body. Someone seems to
<ce>                    have already looted it first.
<ce>
<ce>          During the time you inspected the body, it appears
<ce>            you've attracted the real killer's attention.

Message:  1065
<ce>             Hard as it is to believe, this appears to be
<ce>          your mark. Surely vampires can be outlaws as well.
