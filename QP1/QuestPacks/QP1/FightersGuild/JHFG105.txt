<ce>      Ever fought a daedroth before, %pcf?
<ce>   They hit hard, but as long as you can hurt one,
<ce>   they fall pretty fast. I'm hoping you can make that happen
<ce>   in this case. Would you be willing to take a journey out
<ce>   of town to clean up a failed summoning? 

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>         That's kinda disappointing.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>         Okay, great. The case is that some newly-minted
<ce>   mage over in ___house_ got to thinking he'd like
<ce>   a pet imp, and decided to open a portal to
<ce>   who-knows-where. Apparently imps and daedra are about
<ce>   as common out in the outer realms, or so I'm told.
<ce>   A daedroth jumped right through and started wreaking
<ce>   havoc all over the house. You've got to get to
<ce>   _house_ in ___house_. Kill the monster
<ce>   and tell me about it in =timer_ days' time.
<ce>   I'll have a nice _reward_ waiting for you here.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     _qgiver_ told you to return
<ce>                    to ___qgiver_ by today to tell %g2
<ce>                     about slaying the daedroth.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  All right, it's yours then.

Message:  1010
<ce>       This building is filled with magical contamination.
<ce>   The daedroth must be within.

Message:  1011
<ce>  (AGILITY CHECK FAILED)
<ce>   
<ce>   This daedroth definitely knows how to wield an axe.
<ce>   It laughs at your clumsy movements,
<ce>   and gets in a free swipe at you.

Message:  1012
<ce>  This daedroth is no more.

Message:  1013
<ce>   Nice work. I tell you what, a daedroth getting out
<ce>   into the streets is very bad business. Sometimes even the
<ce>   town guard don't have weapons for that kinda thing.
<ce>   I told you I had this _reward_ for you, and I do,
<ce>   but I wanted to see if you'd prefer this _reward2_.
<ce>   Which one do you wanna pick?
<ce>   
<ce>   (YES: _reward_. NO: _reward2_.)
