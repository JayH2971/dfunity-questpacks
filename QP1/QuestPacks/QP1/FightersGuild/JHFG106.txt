<ce>                 Hey %pcf, maybe you can help us out.
<ce>         We've got this fellow who's marked up and down with
<ce>          death threats. Can't even bear going to his house,
<ce>          so he's been sleeping out in taverns for the last
<ce>             week. He thinks if he's got someone from the
<ce>           guild with him, he can at least go back and pick
<ce>           up his stuff. You wanna play bodyguard and take
<ce>                  him to ___res_ for =reward_ gold?
                                     <--->
<ce>                  %pcf, I'm glad you're here. We've
<ce>            got this guy who needs help getting back home.
<ce>           Apparently he's been getting death threats like
<ce>       Oblivion's never seen before. He won't go there without
<ce>         someone watching his back. He's paying =reward_ gold
<ce>                      to get to ___res_. You in?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   He's off shivering in a corner,
<ce>                         %pcf. Have a heart.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>         All right, but I'll warn you, this stuff's serious.
<ce>                I don't know whose in-law he insulted
<ce>               or who he cheated, but I read the letter
<ce>              he got and it ain't pretty. Anyway, let me
<ce>           call him. He didn't even want to leave the guild
<ce>               hall without someone watching his back.
 
<ce>              Hey! We got someone for ya, come down now!
<ce>                This %ra's gonna get you home! Name's
<ce>                       %pcn. You can trust %g2.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   You hear an awful groaning sound
<ce>                   and a heavy thump on the floor.
<ce>                     It appears you have failed.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>       You are glad you were assigned this matter. Someone less
<ce>         capable could have tarnished the guild's reputation.

RumorsPostFailure:  [1006]
The Fighters Guild runs a pretty poor bodyguard service, they say.

RumorsPostSuccess:  [1007]
The Fighters Guild, protecting stuff? Doesn't sound like them.

QuestorPostFailure:  [1009]
If our clients keep dying under your watch, I'm just gonna stop giving you bodyguard jobs.

<ce>            Your client cautiously creeps down the stairs.
<ce>
<ce>                 "Please forgive me, %pcn. You cannot
<ce>                imagine the horrors I've lived for the
<ce>                  last few days. Please, take me to
<ce>                       ___res_. I was living in
<ce>                         _res_. I'll pay you
<ce>                          once we're there."

<ce>                  You hear rustling inside the home.
<ce>                        Your client trembles.
<ce>
<ce>                  "No! They're here! And they'll be
<ce>                    outside! I knew it all along!
<ce>                   Kill them before they kill me!"
<ce>
<ce>                  Before you can react, he flees in
<ce>                 terror to another area of the house.

Message:  1028
<ce>                 Your client cautiously peeks around
<ce>                   to ensure you are still standing
<ce>                    and not the assassins. When he
<ce>                    is satisfied, he sighs deeply.

Message:  1029
<ce>                 "My word! %pcn, you have provided me
<ce>                proof that all my fears were just, and
<ce>              saved my life in the process! I must flee
<ce>                      to ___escape_ quickly, now
<ce>               that I have my belongings. Thank you for
<ce>            extending your incredible skill on my behalf!"
<ce>
<ce>                       He hands you the payment
<ce>                 before returning to pack his things.

 I've been assigned by
 The Fighters Guild in
 ___qgiver_ as a bodyguard
 to a fellow who lives in
 ___res_. I have to escort him to
 _res_ and ensure no
 one's inside. I have =timer_ days.

Message:  1040
<ce>             Silence pervades the house. A moment's wait
<ce>               makes it clear no one is inside. Perhaps
<ce>                      the threats were in vain.
<ce>
<ce>          "No! It must be you then! This is a trap, an awful
<ce>            trap! I never should have trusted the Fighters
<ce>        Guild! Of course it would be some %ra that slays me!"
<ce>
<ce>                   Paranoia floods _escort_'s mind.
<ce>        Feeling trapped, %g1 draws a weapon to defend %g2self.

Message:  1041
<ce>              Your restraint speaks volumes. _escort_'s
<ce>      madness begins to subside, and %g1 speaks to you plainly.
<ce>
<ce>         "I... am so sorry. You truly are here to protect me,
<ce>              aren't you? %oth. %god forgive me. Please,
<ce>       just take the money and go. I need to leave and go far,
<ce>           far away. %crn is no home for me. Thank you for
<ce>                      preserving my life, %pcf."

<ce>
<ce>       "Please, please forgive me. I am so ashamed. My mind is
<ce>        wracked with the events of past weeks. Take the money
<ce>     and go. I am in no condition to deal with other people now.
<ce>             You are truly a credit to your order, %pcf."

Message:  1042
<ce>           Surely you are justified in defending yourself.
<ce>      This cannot be called a crime, though the Fighters Guild's
<ce>            reputation may not come out of this stainless.

Message:  1043
<ce>              You have slain your client in cold blood.
<ce>                  Word of this will reach _qgiver_.
