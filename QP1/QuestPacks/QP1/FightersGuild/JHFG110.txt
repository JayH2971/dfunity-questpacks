<ce>      Some idiot knight went down into a hole
<ce>   to kill some tigers, and one of them was too tough.
<ce>   Not only did the knight run away like a wimp,
<ce>   but he lost an important personal possession
<ce>   to it, too. He's paying gold if someone can bring
<ce>   it back to me. You in on this one?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>     Well, tigers can be vicious, I guess.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>      The place is called ___dung_. I'll mark it on your map.
<ce>   Apparently most of the tigers were wiped out, or so
<ce>   the guy said. I dunno what you're gonna find in there,
<ce>   but your job is to bring back some _trinket_
<ce>   that he accidentally dropped during the scuffle.
<ce>   It might be wrapped in a bag.
<ce>   If you can have it back to me in =timer_ days,
<ce>   he'll have =reward_ gold for you in return.
<ce>   The tiger itself doesn't matter. If it's that tough,
<ce>   I'd rather see it die of old age than claim
<ce>   one of our guild members.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>   Your time to return the knight's heirloom
<ce>   to __qg_ has passed.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>     I knew you'd do it! I even told that knight
<ce>   to bring me the money ahead of time, that's
<ce>   how sure I was of you. So, your money's here.
<ce>   Enjoy it.

Fighters will always win against knights, eh %pcf?

Message:  1010
<ce>  This bag is rather conspicuous. You grab and open it,
<ce>  and find the _trinket_ inside. This must belong
<ce>  to the knight.

%qdt:
 __qg_ of ___qg_ has sent me to 
 a cave called ___dung_ to retrieve an
 heirloom belonging to a knight who
 tried adventuring inside.
 There might be a tiger guarding it, but
 what matters is delivering the
 _trinket_ to _qg_ within =timer_
 days' time. It may be wrapped in a bag.
