<ce>              Hey %pcf, I've got some news you might be
<ce>         interested in hearing. Turns out in some cave around
<ce>      here there's an artifact, like the real, ancient, powerful
<ce>          kind. Heard of Auriel's Bow, Chrysamere, that kind
<ce>      of thing? This is one of those artifacts. It's being held
<ce>          by a vampire ancient way down in there, guarded by
<ce>       a whole cult of his. I've talked with some of the other
<ce>        guild members, and we've all agreed we're not touching
<ce>      it with a ten-foot pole. Then you showed up and I figured
<ce>    I'd tell you. No shame if you fail to get it, all right? I'll
<ce>              tell you where it is if you're interested.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          Good. I really don't want to lose you down there.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Well, all right then. It's in ___dung_.
<ce>          Take everything you've got. I said there's a cult
<ce>        down there, and I'm not kidding. Those folks are nuts,
<ce>     but like loony. It's gonna be a fight for your life 'til you
<ce>       find the head honcho. If it gets bad, promise me you're
<ce>          gonna run, all right? Good luck down there buddy.
<ce>                       Come back in one piece.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            With the artifact in your hands, this cult has
<ce>             lost its attraction. Your quest is complete.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
There's a cult down in ___dung_. Don't bother no one, though.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
So you actually beat the cult. You're a legend.

Message:  1019
<ce>          You immediately notice a powerful aura of death in
<ce>               ___dung_. The cult takes notice of you.

Message:  1021
<ce>                  The cult's numbers appear endless.
<ce>                     You may wish to reconsider.

Message:  1020
<ce>               The vampire ancient emits a shrill hiss.
<ce>            Waves of power seem to pulse through the air.
