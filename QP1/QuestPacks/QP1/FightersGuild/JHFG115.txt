QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>          We've got someone looking for a fighting partner,
<ce>           wanting to go down into some cave, smash up some
<ce>          bandits, and split the loot. Talks about offering
<ce>            some enchanted item for it. Wanna take it up?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        Prefer working alone?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            "Well then, I'll introduce you two. Hold on."
<ce>
<ce>                  _questgiver_ hollers at the door.
<ce>                 Soon your client enters to meet you.
<ce>
<ce>                     "Hello there! %pcn, you say?
<ce>                         My name is _friend_.
<ce>                  A pleasure. Let us go to ___dung_.
<ce>            I know a band of criminals is taking up refuge
<ce>           there, and we would spend our time well clearing
<ce>            it out. I'll give you this magic _reward_ once
<ce>               we're all finished. Let's be off, then!"

<ce>                     You consider your job done.

Message:  1019
<ce>                         _friend_ speaks up.
<ce>
<ce>              "So my _reward_ for your fighting, right?
<ce>                This place should be lucrative enough
<ce>                to pay for that, I assume. We'll split
<ce>                 the items we find on the criminals."
<ce>
<ce>            The words leave some doubt for %g3 sincerity.

Message:  1020
<ce>            "Well, I'm satisfied. I think we both came out
<ce>          much richer than we expected. Take your _reward_.
<ce>             Maybe I'll see you again in ___questgiver_."
<ce>
<ce>                     _friend_ tosses you the item
<ce>                      and disappears from view.

Message:  1021
<ce>                         _friend_ speaks up.
<ce>
<ce>                  "Listen, I know we agreed on this,
<ce>              but you've been taking way too much here!
<ce>             I'm not even sure I can turn a profit today.
<ce>             To me it's fair that we both just walk away
<ce>              with what we have on hand and forget about
<ce>               this whole deal. Thanks for your help."
<ce>
<ce>           It appears %g1 is about to leave. If you wanted,
<ce>                 you could slay %g2 to get %g3 item.
<ce>                      Will you let %g2 go free?

Message:  1022
<ce>             As %g1 disappears, you know you've at least
<ce>             held on to your honor, to say nothing of the
<ce>            Fighters Guild's reputation. Someone else will
<ce>               have to teach %g2 not to break %g3 word.

Message:  1023
<ce>                            "Wait, what?"
<ce>
<ce>              Your attack comes as a complete surprise.

Message:  1025
<ce>                  Hey %pcf, have you seen _friend_?
<ce>             'Cause %g1 was headed right here after your
<ce>                        romp down in ___dung_.
<ce>
<ce>                 Dead? Oh, come on, that's not right.
<ce>                 That's not what the guild works for.
<ce>             Listen, do me a favor and keep it a secret.
<ce>               ___questgiver_ needs the Fighters Guild,
<ce>                and if word starts to spread that some
<ce>                  moron takes people to their deaths
<ce>                    in random caves the %t's gonna
<ce>                  run us out of here. Let's pretend
<ce>                   this never happened, all right?
