<ce>                  Hey %pcf, glad you're around. Just
<ce>                being straight with ya, but something
<ce>                weird's going on in the city. I dunno
<ce>                 what's causing it. We've got a rash
<ce>                  of summoned monsters showing up in
<ce>                shops, wreaking havoc. You'll probably
<ce>                hear about it if you stick around for
<ce>                a few minutes. Want to give us a hand
<ce>                going around for a few exterminations?
                                     <--->
<ce>               %pcf, could you stick around for awhile?
<ce>              ___questgiver_'s not looking all that hot
<ce>           right now. Some problem with randomly appearing
<ce>            monsters has everyone spooked, and it's just a
<ce>              matter of time before we hear another call
<ce>                  for help. You wanna play the hero?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               Fine then. Go find something else to do.
                                     <--->
<ce>        No big deal. The Fighters Guild has plenty of heroes.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                You hear a scream coming from outside.
<ce>
<ce>                  "It's in _place1_! Someone help!"
<ce>
<ce>              _questgiver_ says, "Well, that's your cue.
<ce>           We'll talk about your reward when they're dead.
<ce>             Just don't let up 'til it's over, all right?
<ce>       There are innocent people in this city that need help."
                                     <--->
<ce>                You hear a scream coming from outside.
<ce>
<ce>                  "A monster's gotten into _place1_!
<ce>   There are innocent people in there! Someone, please help them!"
<ce>
<ce>                 _questgiver_ says, "Well, get going.
<ce>           I'll gather up some kinda reward when it's over.
<ce>          Don't go dragging your feet, either. People could
<ce>                       die if you're too slow."

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               The town guard's not going to keep this
<ce>             city safe, and neither will you apparently.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             You have fun, %pcf? What a rush. It's a good
<ce>             thing we've got people like you around here.
<ce>              Hopefully we'll find out who's behind this
<ce>                and put a longsword between his ribs.
<ce>                  But that's neither here nor there.
<ce>             Take this, enjoy it. And don't be surprised
<ce>              if the %t finds out about your good deed.
                                     <--->
<ce>              Wowie! You can haul like the best of 'em,
<ce>                huh %pcf? Great job. I'm sure the %t's
<ce>              gonna want to know who kept the city safe
<ce>            today. Sure wasn't the town guard. We sent out
<ce>              some of our other people to fight off imps
<ce>             while you were busy, but they're just gonna
<ce>              get some gold. The real reward's for you.
<ce>                          All yours, buddy.

QuestorPostSuccess:  [1008]
___questgiver_ owes you big-time, buddy.

QuestorPostFailure:  [1009]
Thankfully other people kept the city safe in your absence.
