QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>               Got a guild member who's feeling really
<ce>              depressed. The fellow's here in town, just
<ce>              sort of moping around, unable to get back
<ce>              in the groove. I bet you'd be pretty good
<ce>                    at changing that, right %pcf?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  I still say so, even if you don't.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               All right then, go on and find him over
<ce>                     in _res_. Poor guy's really
<ce>               shaken up, but I don't know what about.
<ce>                     Name's _guy_. See if you can
<ce>                 get his head back in a right place.
<ce>                 I'll have =reward_ gold for you when
<ce>          you're done. Don't take longer than =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                      _guy_ feeling any better?
<ce>                      No? I'll be waiting here.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Haa, I knew you could do it!
<ce>                  This is definitely worth the gold.
<ce>                   I need someone like him to kill
<ce>                     rats and tigers while you're
<ce>                         frying the big fish.

Message:  1010
<ce>                   "Oh what? What're you here for?
<ce>                         _qgiver_... Oh, %g2.
<ce>                 No, no, I'm not interested. I'm done
<ce>              with the guild. It's not the life for me."
<ce>
<ce>               You spend some time trying to force the
<ce>                  reason out of him and are met with
<ce>                 blunt resistance. Finally, with some
<ce>                exasperation he blurts out the truth.
<ce>
<ce>                  "It's because of ___dung_, okay?!
<ce>                Filthy den of vipers nearly killed me!
<ce>                 I hadn't spent more than an hour in
<ce>                   there before I was nearly dead!
<ce>               Unless you're going to take me there and
<ce>               show me how a real fighter acts, I don't
<ce>                       want to hear about it!"
<ce>
<ce>                 It looks like there's only one thing
<ce>            that will convince him. A little begrudgingly,
<ce>                 he agrees to follow you to ___dung_.
<ce>                If anything can help him overcome his
<ce>                        trauma, it'll be this.

Message:  1011
<ce>                         _guy_ starts shaking once you enter.
<ce>
<ce>                "You know what? Fighting's all yours.
<ce>            I'm not doing a thing 'til I see you survive."

Message:  1012
<ce>                 Your confidence begins to rub off on
<ce>                      _guy_. Getting a feel for
<ce>                adventure, he smiles, perhaps for the
<ce>                         first time in weeks.
<ce>
<ce>                "You know what? I'm better than this.
<ce>                     %oth, why am I even talking?
<ce>                        I can do this. I can!"
<ce>
<ce>               He then leaves you to begin adventuring
<ce>                     anew. _qgiver_ will be happy
<ce>                         to hear about this.

Message:  1013
<ce>               "We've taken far too long for this, and
<ce>                     I have better things to do."
<ce>
<ce>                  _guy_ marches off somewhere else.

Message:  1014
<ce>           (ETIQUETTE/STREETWISE/PERSONALITY CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>                    _guy_ clearly doesn't want to
<ce>           speak to you or anyone from the Fighters Guild.
<ce>            Then again, someone with your speaking ability
<ce>                  has breached far greater barriers.
<ce>            You discuss his difficulties on a recent guild
<ce>              job and talk through what to do next time
<ce>                             it happens.
