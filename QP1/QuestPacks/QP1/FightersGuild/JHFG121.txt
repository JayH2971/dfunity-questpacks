<ce>             Someone here in ___qgiver_'s gotten into so
<ce>            much debt that running away's the only option.
<ce>             Apparently there are headhunters on the way,
<ce>          so this might get ugly. Wanna keep this one safe?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                On second thought, I don't blame you.
                                     <--->
<ce>          You know, that's probably a pretty smart decision.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   You're gonna find _friend_ over
<ce>                    in _res_ here in town. You'll
<ce>              be taking %g2 to %g3 house in another town
<ce>            first to pick up %g3 things, and then lead %g2
<ce>             to a hideout, wherever that's gonna be. From
<ce>             there you'll get paid and you're home free.
<ce>            So head on over there and see how it'll work.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>          "Well, you know, we've taken quite awhile and not
<ce>          gotten to where I needed to be. I think it's fair
<ce>          to call it off here, wouldn't you say? Good day."
<ce>
<ce>               A momentary distraction is enough to let
<ce>               _friend_ escape. You lose track of %g2.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>           You decide against revenge and leave %g2 to %g3
<ce>              ill-gotten peace. Your hands will not have
<ce>                          %g3 blood on them.

QuestorPostFailure:  [1009]
I can't really trust you to keep debtors safe, can I?

Message:  1010
<ce>           Hi there! You're from the Fighters Guild, then?
<ce>                  Oh good. _qgiver_ promised me he'd
<ce>        send someone capable. I guess that's a compliment, huh
<ce>        friend? Ha ha ha! Well, um, I've just been hiding out
<ce>          here for awhile. I need to get back to ___farhome_
<ce>         and pick up my clothes and what little goods I have.
<ce>           The banks have carted off most of my things, but
<ce>           they haven't gotten to this last house, I think.
<ce>                It's called _farhome_. From there I'll
<ce>           tell you where you'll take me. So then, lead the
<ce>               way, champion! My life is in your hands!

Message:  1011
<ce>              Ah, good, my things are here. Let me see.
<ce>
<ce>           Well, some of it, at least. My business partners
<ce>           have apparently raided the house at least once.
<ce>           Poor sports, or losers, I should say. I'm forced
<ce>             to work with such scoundrels. Not like you,
<ce>             eh good buddy? Ha ha ha! Now, let's head on
<ce>                     to ___farmhome_. I've worked
<ce>            out a new identity for myself there, and I'll
<ce>                be quite content to get a fresh start.
<ce>                     Whenever you're ready, %pcf.

Message:  1012
<ce>              "Ah, ___farmhome_! What a blissful sight!
<ce>            I can't wait to start to develop it. The other
<ce>             co-owners have had some objections, but they
<ce>           know I'm good for it. I explain that little bit
<ce>           to you, my dear friend, in the hopes that you'll
<ce>            understand why I can't pay you for this little
<ce>           trip. All my assets are in illiquid commodities,
<ce>          and I can't pull out a simple sum of money to pay
<ce>            you, at least not for a few years. But I thank
<ce>           you for your good work. The practice you got on
<ce>            the way was worth your time, wasn't it? Let's
<ce>                          leave it at that."
<ce>
<ce>                     Do you let _friend_ get away
<ce>                     with this obvious deception?

Message:  1013
<ce>               Your insistence that %g1 stop avails you
<ce>                nothing. You decide there is just one
<ce>                    way to get what you've earned.
<ce>
<ce>                    "Friend? What are you doing?"

Message:  1014
<ce>                       You have slain _friend_.

Message:  1020
<ce>                A group of armed enforcers approaches.
<ce>
<ce>          "Excuse me %ra, but you seem to be traveling with
<ce>                some pond scum named _friend_. You'll
<ce>            want to step aside. We have a warrant for %g3
<ce>                     capture on behalf of _bank_.
<ce>          We are authorized to give you =reward_ gold pieces
<ce>              for your cooperation. Please stand down."
<ce>
<ce>            Do you surrender _friend_ to the authorities?

Message:  1021
<ce>                          "Good choice. Go."
<ce>
<ce>               Against _friend_'s bewildered protests,
<ce>            you deliver %g2 into the hands of %g3 enemies.
<ce>               One of the mercenaries hands you a pouch
<ce>                 full of money, and the band departs.
<ce>                 You count out =reward_ gold pieces.

Message:  1022
<ce>                  The mercenaries nod at one another
<ce>                       and begin their assault.
