QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             Hey, you have the time, %pcf? I've got a job
<ce>      here for a tavern in town, but I'm not supposed to give it
<ce>      out after 9 PM. They're gonna have a get-together of some
<ce>         kind and they're worried about drunks, fights, that
<ce>       kinda thing. It's paying standard fare, if you want it.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>      It sounds like pretty tame stuff. Sure you don't want it?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>       All right, but if it's after 9 right now it's your fault
<ce>          for not catching me on it. The party's gonna be at
<ce>                _tav_ here in town. You'll stay there
<ce>           from 9 to sunrise or whenever they dismiss you,
<ce>           whichever comes first. Keep the people safe and
<ce>            you'll get paid your =reward_ gold. Report to
<ce>                      _prop_ when you get there.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    The party at _tav_ has begun,
<ce>                   but you are nowhere to be found.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    _prop_ comes looking for you.
<ce>
<ce>           "The Fighters Guild's reputation is well earned.
<ce>          We'll call for you next time we do one of these."

QuestorPostFailure:  [1009]
_prop_ keeps telling everyone about how bad you were for _tav_.

Message:  1010
<ce>                      _prop_ is waiting for you.
<ce>
<ce>              "Fighters Guild? All right. Stay here and
<ce>                 make sure things stay under control.
<ce>               I'll come for you when your shift's up."

Message:  1011
<ce>        The abundant alcohol in the tavern reduces some of the
<ce>        patrons' inhibitions. One decides to run home to bring
<ce>           a pet spider in to impress the others, but acute
<ce>         arachnophobia takes them over, and the loud shouting
<ce>        makes the creature panic. Soon it starts attacking all
<ce>                 nearby living beings, including you.

Message:  1012
<ce>                  The spider's owner sobs bitterly,
<ce>                 but _prop_ nods to you in approval.

Message:  1013
<ce>              "I heard there was a party going on here!
<ce>                   Who's got the money bag, huh?!"
<ce>
<ce>             A group of scoundrels enters the tavern and
<ce>               begins to shake the people down. _prop_
<ce>             yells that they have a bodyguard and points
<ce>              to you, leading the criminals toward you.

Message:  1014
<ce>        The drunken haze of the party makes some in attendance
<ce>         believe this was all staged for their entertainment.
<ce>           Once the smell of blood becomes apparent they'll
<ce>                     probably change their minds.

Message:  1015
<ce>        An impromptu lottery game starts up among the patrons.
<ce>        The winner will receive a sum of =smallg_ gold pieces
<ce>       based on the donations of others. You are informed that,
<ce>    as the night watch for the party, you can participate without
<ce>            paying the entry fee. Do you join the lottery?

Message:  1016
<ce>            Names are put into a hat, and one is selected.
<ce>
<ce>                    "_dummy_, come get your gold!"
<ce>
<ce>         You return to your duties as the diversion subsides.

Message:  1017
<ce>            Names are put into a hat, and one is selected.
<ce>
<ce>                     "%pcn, come get your gold!"
<ce>
<ce>       Someone does you the favor of delivering the money, but
<ce>           one malcontent gets suspicious of your victory.
<ce>        A mix of alcohol and bravado leads to a confrontation.
<ce>         _prop_ signals that self-defense is justified here.

Message:  1018
<ce>   Fortunately, your assailant wasn't known to any of the patrons.
<ce>          Likely just a citizen of ___tav_ who wandered in.

Message:  1019
<ce>      A patron slumps down, and the tavern lights up with alarm.
<ce>                         _prop_ runs to you.
<ce>
<ce>        "Alcohol poisoning. You're the most sober person here.
<ce>                   Can you get this one to _temp_?
<ce>        He's got family over there who can cure him for free.
<ce>           Make sure it's the right temple. Please hurry."
<ce>
<ce>                  The inert body is brought to you.
<ce>                This fellow's life now depends on you.

Message:  1020
<ce>        So soon as you enter the temple, the nearby attendant
<ce>      turns pale and runs for help. Soon a bevy of helpers takes
<ce>      the body from you for curing, which occurs without delay.
<ce>       The first attendant promptly informs you of the success.

Message:  1021
<ce>              Curiously, you notice nearby a bag of gold
<ce>              which appears to be out of everyone else's
<ce>                sight. The adrenaline rush of today's
<ce>               events may have worn them out too much,
<ce>              lending to momentary distraction.
<ce>             The bag appears to hold more than a thousand gold.
<ce>                 Will you attempt to take it for yourself?

Message:  1022
<ce>                  (STEALTH/PICKPOCKET CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>           This is all too easy for one of your skill set.
<ce>               The bag of money is now yours, adding an
<ce>            additional =stealg_ gold pieces to your count.

Message:  1023
<ce>                  (STEALTH/PICKPOCKET CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>           Your movement while grabbing the coin bag is too
<ce>           obvious. Someone peering over sees that you have
<ce>          your hand on property which is clearly not yours.
<ce>           The night hours are shattered by a shrill yell.
<ce>
<ce>             "THIEF! The Fighters Guild sent us a thief!
<ce>                            Someone help!"
<ce>
<ce>             Something tells you they will not be paying
<ce>              for your guard service. Perhaps you should
<ce>              work on your thieving skills before trying
<ce>                       to rip off your clients.

Message:  1026
<ce>   The crowd breaks out in an impromptu song, entirely out of key.

Message:  1027
<ce> "Oh yeah? You wanna fight about it? Come over here, I'll teach ya!"
<ce>
<ce>                       A fight fails to start.

Message:  1029
<ce>         "How's about we see if we throw bottles at that %ra
<ce>           patrolling the tavern, see who hits %pg2 first?
<ce>                              Ha ha ha!"
<ce>
<ce>         _prop_ rolls %g3 eyes and slaps the offender's head.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild in ___questgiver_ has assigned
 me to guard _tav_ during a party tonight.
 I have to be there by 21:00 and stand guard until
 I am dismissed.

Message:  1031
<ce>         "Hey, I got an idea! How's about we take that scroll
<ce>       you took from the Mages Guild and read it out together?"
<ce>
<ce>       Before anyone has sense enough to stop them, two drunks
<ce>      read out what they presume to be the words on the scroll.
<ce>        A creature with no allegiance appears out of thin air.

Message:  1032
<ce>          The people hoot and holler at your combat prowess.

Message:  1033
<ce>     "See this trick? I've got me a pet dragon! Watch, you all!"
<ce>
<ce>        A flash of light then bursts forth, and a small, scaly
<ce>               creature begins flapping about. _prop_,
<ce>       familiar with this trick, insists that you not kill it.

Message:  1034
<ce>                  "That filthy %ra killed my dragon!
<ce>                  What's wrong with you, ingrate?!"
<ce>
<ce>                _prop_ tries to calm the rowing crowd,
<ce>            but this is a bit too much for %g2 to handle.
<ce>            Apparently you won't be getting paid for this.

Message:  1035
 %qdt:
_prop_ needs me to take a drunk
to _temp_ in town.

Message:  1036
<ce>             The drunk has stopped breathing altogether.
<ce>              It took you far too long to get to _temp_.
<ce>             _prop_, too irate for words, refuses to pay.

Message:  1037
<ce>           The dragon is pulled back into a small runed box
<ce>     held by one of the patrons, and they all roar with laughter.
