<ce>              Ah, perfect. I bet you'd be right for this
<ce>               one thing. We've got a bet running that
<ce>              no one can survive a swarm of fifty bats.
<ce>                     You wanna prove them wrong?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 Man, I've got money riding on this.
<ce>                          Who's gonna do it?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>           Awesome! I'm with ya. People here are absolutely
<ce>          convinced that fifty is too many, but we're gonna
<ce>               prove 'em wrong. You'll need this chest.
<ce>       Go to one of them shrines out in the middle of nowhere,
<ce>         the ones called "Shrine of This" or "Monument That."
<ce>         Open it up there. Do it anywhere else and the bet's
<ce>           off. Once they start showing up the bats're just
<ce>          gonna attack you, so don't worry about the shrine
<ce>      attendant. You just survive and come back here, all right?
<ce>               And no running away. We'll be watching.

<ce>                        "Hey, no! Not there!"
<ce>
<ce>              The chest disappears with a puff of smoke.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               That's how we do it, buddy. Great work.
<ce>               I took the time to turn your share into
<ce>                  something more useful than money.

Some spellsword is getting rich from defending the Mages Guild from intruders.

<ce>                      You hear _qgiver_'s voice
<ce>               come from the wood siding of the chest.
<ce>
<ce>             "Okay, this place is good. Don't go too far
<ce>             from the shrine. Open it when you're ready."

Message:  1011
<ce>                   The last bat dies, and you hear
<ce>                    _qgiver_ erupt into laughter.
<ce>
<ce>              "All right suckers, you saw it yourselves!
<ce>                Hand it here! Hey %pcf, I've got your
<ce>                share when you get back. Travel safe."
<ce>
<ce>           The chest finally disappears in a puff of smoke.

Message:  1013
<ce>          You put the chest on the ground and open the lid.
<ce>         Apparitions of winged creatures start to swarm out,
<ce>                      all trained to attack you.

%qdt:
 I'm trying to fulfill a bet
 _qgiver_ of __qgiver_
 made about killing fifty bats.
 He gave me a chest that I need
 to open near one of the remote
 shrines in the countryside.
 If I kill the bats and survive,
 I can return to ___qgiver_
 for my share of the bet.
