<ce>             There's a group of criminals in town who've
<ce>                 absconded with some pretty important
<ce>              evidence. Someone needs to go in quick and
<ce>            wipe 'em out before they do some irreversible
<ce>               damage. Feeling like moving fast today?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        Need to relax instead?
<ce>                    They'll figure something out.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               These thugs're trapped in a building in
<ce>              town, trying to barter their freedom with
<ce>              this little piece of paper they've stolen.
<ce>              They said they'll burn it if someone tries
<ce>             to get in. I don't think they'll do anything
<ce>             risky if they just see someone, but once you
<ce>             start the fight, you better finish it fast.
<ce>              One of 'em has to have it. Bring the paper
<ce>              back here and I'll have a reward for you.
<ce>
<ce>                     Oh, almost forgot. _random_.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Good enough. Trust me, if they sent in
<ce>                the guards to do this, all they'd find
<ce>                 is a bunch of warm ashes. The %t is
<ce>               right to ask us this, even if I dislike
<ce>                              saying it.

Message:  1010
<ce>                 This thug yells some code words, and
<ce>                    others come out of hiding. You
<ce>                  smell something burning but don't
<ce>                     know where it's coming from.

Message:  1011
<ce>                You quickly rummage through your foes'
<ce>                items and find the burning parchment.
<ce>                 Slapping the fire out, you store it
<ce>                        as safely as you can.

Message:  1012
<ce>                  The burning has ceased. One of the
<ce>                     thieves smirks triumphantly.
<ce>                    You have failed to stop them.

Message:  1013
<ce>                Though burnt, this parchment describes
<ce>                  a series of past and future crimes
<ce>                   across %crn. It's still legible.
