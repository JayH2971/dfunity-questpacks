QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> Hey, this is kind of weird to say, but I've
<ce> got a letter here with the Dark Brotherhood's seal
<ce> on it, and your name too. Is this something
<ce> that could actually be meant for you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> And I'm already tearing it up. Don't
<ce> want that around here, no sirree.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> All right, but just a favor I'm gonna ask,
<ce> try to keep that stuff out of here, all right?
<ce> A lot of our people are decent folk.
<ce> I mean, I trust you for your work, but
<ce> we've got a reputation to maintain here.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> You discard the Dark Brotherhood letter,
<ce> having never read its contents.
