QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              Got an escort mission... I think. This one
<ce>              gives me the creeps. It's got all kinds of
<ce>              stuff I don't like about it, but I've got
<ce>             to take it seriously and offer it just like
<ce>               any other job. If you wanna take someone
<ce>               to another town and feel ready for some
<ce>               tough combat, I could use you right now.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Yeah, I don't blame you. Maybe he'll give up.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             I owe you one. Really, I can't give this out
<ce>           in good faith without telling you that something
<ce>          just feels bad about it. Anyway, I won't hold you
<ce>                  any longer. Go look for _person_,
<ce>                who's in _place_. Take %g2 on over to
<ce>                       a place called _home_ in
<ce>                 ___home_. And be ready for anything,
<ce>             'cause the rumors I hear about this =person_
<ce>             are not pleasant stuff. Safe journey, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                        Everything all right?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 "This is my friend! Won't you offer
<ce>                that payment we agreed on, dear sir?"
<ce>
<ce>                    _person_'s odd behavior nearly
<ce>             distracts you as this cloaked figure reaches
<ce>              out to touch you with its finger. You see
<ce>             a grin cross its face as it grazes you. Your
<ce>               surroundings begin to shimmer. Something
<ce>                    is happening. _person_ flees.
<ce>
<ce>               "I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! They demanded
<ce>               a sacrifice and I couldn't bear to do it
<ce>                     myself! Please forgive me!"
<ce>
<ce>                The hooded figure silently warps away,
<ce>                   and other beings take its place.

Some idiot here in town let a tiger get into his house. Lucky the Fighters Guild exists.

Message:  1011
<ce>                 Oh! Are you from the Fighters Guild?
<ce>                     H-hello, I'm _person_. Thank
<ce>              you for coming. I need help getting home.
<ce>                    I live in ___home_, I'm afraid
<ce>               of traveling that far and I want someone
<ce>                to keep me safe as I go. Can you take
<ce>                 me there? I have a friend who'll pay
<ce>                 you =reward_ gold when we get there.
<ce>                 I need to be there in =timer_ days.

Message:  1013
<ce>               While you battled these daedra, _person_
<ce>                has most likely run far from ___home_.
<ce>           You wonder whether %g3 account with Oblivion has
<ce>               been settled by now. At least these foes
<ce>                 should carry reward enough for you.

Message:  1014
<ce>            Rather than remain in this deathtrap, you flee
<ce>        the building. The daedra appear to have no interest in
<ce>             pursuing you. Meanwhile, you hear _person_'s
<ce>                           voice from afar.
<ce>
<ce>            "No! Leave me alone! You want the %ra, not me!
<ce>                  Someone help, they're taking me--"
<ce>
<ce>                     Then %g3 voice trails away.

Message:  1021
<ce>                 A warping effect surrounds _person_,
<ce>           and space itself appears to distort. The effect
<ce>           rapidly builds until it seems as though the air
<ce>             itself is about to hemorrhage magical power.
<ce>               Once %g1 notices %g3 eyes grow wide but
<ce>                 there is nothing you can do; %g1 is
<ce>               sucked in amid an otherworldly silence.
