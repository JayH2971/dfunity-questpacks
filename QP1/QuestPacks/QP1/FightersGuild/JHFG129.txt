<ce>              There's a fellow in town who keeps comin'
<ce>              'round demanding a challenger for a fight.
<ce>               Offers gold and everything. I think it's
<ce>               gonna be harder than it looks, but it's
<ce>                        there if you want it.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>           I guess I'll just have to get used to this guy.
<ce>                      No one else wants to try.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Really? All right then. Go to
<ce>                      _res_ here in town. Name's
<ce>                     _pers_. All's I know is that
<ce>                   you just wanna go in and start a
<ce>                  fight. The twit's been aching for
<ce>                 a good one for a long time, he says.
<ce>                  I'll send him word that you'll be
<ce>                   there within, say, two days. Let
<ce>                 you rest up a little if you need it.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                         _pers_ is in _res_.
<ce>                   Head on over when you're ready.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       %oth, you can be lethal.
<ce>
<ce>              Please don't misunderstand. I can be a bit
<ce>              overly dramatic at times, I understand. My
<ce>               siblings tell me as much when they come
<ce>           around. Well, I suppose some explanation is due.
<ce>
<ce>             We belong to a clan who identify with a gift
<ce>         for illusion magic. It's not so much a clan in that
<ce>              we all trace to a common ancestor. We all
<ce>           adopt ourselves, you could say. In any case, we
<ce>             have an interest in expanding our sphere of
<ce>             influence. We are indeed shapeshifters, but
<ce>            we often find ourselves disadvantaged in other
<ce>           fields. Combat in general is something of a weak
<ce>            spot for us. We would enjoy counting you among
<ce>       our allies. If that sounds agreeable, perhaps someday we
<ce>         could seek you out according to our needs.
<ce>             Oh, the things we could accomplish with your skill!
<ce>           But for now, farewell.
<ce>           Thank you for listening to me.

<ce>        "Thank you for coming. Please, tell me your full name.
<ce>
<ce>                "Very well then, %pcn. I wish to test
<ce>         my skills and see if I emerge the victor. I ask that
<ce>        you hold nothing back. I have a small reward available
<ce>       for you if you succeed. And if you leave this building,
<ce>                        you forfeit our duel.
<ce>
<ce>                        "Let our duel begin!"
<ce>
<ce>                       _pers_ shouts a cantrip
<ce>                dramatically before disappearing. You
<ce>              brace yourself for the battle before you.

Message:  1014
<ce>                     The rat keels over. _pers_'s
<ce>              voice breaks your puzzled thought process.
<ce>
<ce>           "Well, you can kill a rat! So what? Take this!"

Message:  1015
<ce>              The bat drops to the ground pathetically.
<ce>                 From its mouth you hear _pers_ say,
<ce>
<ce>               "Warm-ups are over! Now we get serious!"

Message:  1016
<ce>               "No arachnophobe out of you! Get ready!"

Message:  1017
<ce>                From the giant fish's mouth you hear,
<ce>
<ce>                 "Come on, I want a real fight! Show
<ce>                me the mettle of the Fighters Guild!"

Message:  1018
<ce>            The scorpion's body heaves and finally drops.
<ce>
<ce>             "Well, so be it! Let's see you handle this!"

Message:  1019
<ce>               "Not the first wereboar you've seen, eh?
<ce>                    But I'm just getting started!"

Message:  1020
<ce>                       "Hmph! Then watch this!"

Message:  1021
<ce>             "No more ghosts! See if you can beat this!"

Message:  1022
<ce>                "A strength that can even break iron!
<ce>                        But what about this?!"

Message:  1023
<ce>              The levitating dreugh drops to the ground.
<ce>
<ce>        "Pretty impressive, right? But playtime is now over!"

Message:  1024
<ce>                 "Breathing fire, even! But no more.
<ce>                       Here's something else!"

Message:  1025
<ce>             "Stone skin cracked. All my tricks are shot!
<ce>           You leave me with no choice. See my true form!"

Message:  1026
<ce>              The vampire tumbles to the ground. As with
<ce>          the other creatures, a voice comes from its mouth.
<ce>
<ce>              "It's been a long time since someone made
<ce>          it to the vampire. Your skill truly is memorable.
<ce>                       Come, see me once more."
<ce>
<ce>                      _pers_ appears once again.
<ce>             Now you can get to the bottom of the matter.

<ce>                  _pers_'s voice booms in your ears.
<ce>
<ce>                  "HA! I've proven my victory! Leave
