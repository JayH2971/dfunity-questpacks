QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>         Got a weird one that I'm hoping someone will be able
<ce>       to sort out. Says a shapeshifter's plodding around some
<ce>    cemetery, pretending to be a vampire. The request is that you
<ce>    go help kill this thing, since it's too strong for one person.
<ce>                            Wanna take it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      All right, thanks anyway.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               "Well then, let's get you on your way."
<ce>
<ce>           _questgiver_ hollers, and a member of the guild
<ce>       opens the door. A heavily-armed warrior enters and bows.
<ce>
<ce>             "Hail, fighter! I am _fighter_. I thank you
<ce>                 for your intervention on my behalf.
<ce>           We have a shapeshifter to kill, a vile creature!
<ce>             To ___cemetery_ we go, and in =timer_ days!"

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Lots of werewolves been out and about in the night.

Message:  1010
<ce>       "It is yet day, and the monster fits the disguise well,"
<ce>               _fighter_ says. "Let us camp 'til night
<ce>                     and we shall find our foe."

Message:  1011
<ce>                You and _fighter_ notice some movement
<ce>                      nearby and arm yourselves.
<ce>             The being maintains distance and calls out.
<ce>
<ce>      "Halt, adventurers! This cemetery is under my protection.
<ce>    I will allow no further raids upon it! Let the dead rest, and
<ce>                their belongings remain undisturbed!"
<ce>
<ce>           _fighter_ shouts, "You slew my friends who came
<ce>     before me! You deserve no mercy, bloodsucker! You will die!"
<ce>
<ce>        You ask the vampire why it has taken this form and get
<ce>       a confused response. "I don't understand what you mean.
<ce>        I am a vampire, who defends the remains of my family."

Message:  1012
<ce>                      Now outnumbered, _fighter_
<ce>                   fights all the more desperately.

Message:  1013
<ce>              The vampire hisses, preparing for battle.

Message:  1014
<ce>                  _fighter_ sighs. "I'm glad you saw
<ce>          things my way. Monsters like this shouldn't exist.
<ce>          I'll have to come back here with my cart so we can
<ce>          start looting this place. Here, take your money."

Message:  1015
<ce>     The vampire bows. "Your respect for the dead is commendable.
<ce>    I will take my leave shortly, and inform my kin of your deeds.
<ce>                Thank you, %ra, for showing me mercy."
<ce>
<ce>                 You notice a conspicuous money pouch
<ce>           on _fighter_'s body, which must be your reward.
<ce>          Since %g1 won't be around to use it any longer...

Message:  1016
<ce>   Both combatants are dead now. You see a conspicuous money pouch
<ce>           on _fighter_'s body, which must be your reward.
<ce>          Since %g1 won't be around to use it any longer...

Message:  1017
<ce>               You needed to be at ___cemetery_ by now.
<ce>                     _fighter_ huffs off angrily.

Message:  1018
<ce>             _fighter_ shakes %g2 head and turns to you.
<ce>                 "I said that so you'd come out here.
<ce>              I didn't want to tell the guild the truth,
<ce>               so I made up stuff about a shapeshifter.
<ce>                          Now stop talking."
<ce>          Then %g1 shouts at the vampire, "You will die now,
<ce>                         as my friends died!"
<ce>
<ce>       The vampire looks at you with fear but summons courage.
<ce>         "I must defend my family. They are all I have left."
<ce>
<ce>            The two begin to fight. Will you side with the
<ce>                  fighter (yes) or the vampire (no)?
