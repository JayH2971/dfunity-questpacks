QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                   Used to killing many atronachs?
<ce>             We've got a job to kill one in another town.
<ce>             Neighbors are getting freaked out about it,
<ce>                   holed up in a house over there.
<ce>                      Iron atronach, apparently.
<ce>                         Feel ready for this?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    Too bad. Sounds pretty simple.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Get yourself on over to ___house_ to
<ce>               the %di and find a place called _house_.
<ce>            Reports say the atronach does a lot of wailing
<ce>               but not much moving, so it shouldn't be
<ce>        all that hard to find. Take it out and come back here.
<ce>        I'll have your =reward_ gold pieces all ready for you
<ce>                   if you're back in =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               You needed to report on the atronach job
<ce>                         to _qgiver_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Atronach's dead, isn't it? Good work.
<ce>           Those things sure are hard to hit, aren't they?
<ce>            Gotta get the best weaponry for those things,
<ce>                 I say. Glad to pay this out to you.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Some warrior got paid to kill a bunch of imps in a crypt. What a life.

Message:  1010
<ce>            This house is charged with electrical energy.
<ce>               The atronach shouldn't be hard to find.

Message:  1011
<ce>                  You examine the atronach, and find
<ce>                 a note attached to the front of it.
<ce>
<ce>             "EXPERIMENT UNDERWAY. Please do not disturb!
<ce>                 Vital climate experiments in action,
<ce>              subject is inert and will not harm anyone!
<ce>              Please DO NOT call for the Fighters Guild,
<ce>                the Dark Brotherhood, or any others!"
<ce>
<ce>           Perhaps the Fighters Guild may not have had all
<ce>             the information it should have on this job.
<ce>        Or maybe the neighbors don't care about the experiment
<ce>       and want it destroyed anyway. You could finish it here,
<ce>        or leave and try to gather more information about it.

Message:  1012
<ce>               Sensing a threat, the atronach whirs to
<ce>                    life and advances against you.

Message:  1013
<ce>              With the atronach destroyed, it's time to
<ce>            return to ___qgiver_ and report your success.

Message:  1014
<ce>         As you leave the house, a startled mage approaches.
<ce>
<ce>       "Oh dear, oh my! A mercenary? Were you inside the house?
<ce>       You didn't destroy the atronach, I can tell! Thank you,
<ce>         thank you! Oh, months of research would have gone to
<ce>                waste in mere moments while I was out!
<ce>      The golem is part of an experiment to change the weather,
<ce>         create more rain for crops and so on. I'll have you
<ce>        know, I have friends in high places and they will know
<ce>            about this, right away! How good it is to have
<ce>           wiser than ordinary persons holding the weapons
<ce>                     in this realm, I tell you!"
<ce>
<ce>                The spellcaster hurries into the house
<ce>            to cover up whatever work you could have done.
<ce>               You're sure to benefit from this, though
<ce>                you're not sure you'll tell _qgiver_.

Message:  1015
<ce>                 Mages? Experiments? Weather control?
<ce>          That sounds interesting and all %pcf, but you had
<ce>             a job to do. The contract was pretty clear.
<ce>         With the mage alerted now, the thing might not ever
<ce>          get destroyed. The guild's gonna have to back out
<ce>       on this contract entirely, and that's bad for all of us.
<ce>       Next time, I need you to follow the word of a contract,
<ce>                         down to the letter.
