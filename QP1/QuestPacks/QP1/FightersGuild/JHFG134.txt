QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>        Just got this one in today, actually.
<ce>       The %rt posted a bounty for someone
<ce>       hiding out in another town.
<ce>       A few hundred gold and I don't think
<ce>       the fight's gonna be very tough.
<ce>       Wanna handle it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>     Ah, well. Maybe the %rt should pay better.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>           Good, good. So this outlaw's name is Faustinus,
<ce>       I guess. Code words, second names, whatever these things are.
<ce>       Go find this Faustinus in ___house_, %di.
<ce>       The order mentions looking in "_house_."
<ce>       The pay is =reward_ gold and you have to
<ce>       return here in =timer_ days. Keep safe, all right?

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>           You needed to slay Faustinus and report by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>        Done, back, and safe. Always good to hear a job well done.
<ce>                 Count out your gold... here you go.

Message:  1011
<ce>        As you leave the guild hall, you're aware of a note
<ce>       that's pressed into your hand. You didn't see the messenger.
<ce>
<ce>             "%ra, Faustinus is innocent.
<ce>       Please come to _tavern_ here in town.
<ce>       
<ce>                _pers_"
<ce>
<ce>                What happens now is your choice.

Message:  1012
<ce>       You're that %ra from the Fighters Guild?
<ce>    Thank %god, and %god alone.
<ce>    Please listen to me. The %rt has no idea who "Faustinus" is.
<ce>    The whole kill order was sent because of a grudge,
<ce>   someone in the lower courts who can't handle a rival.
<ce>    Please, you're going to kill an innocent bard.
<ce>    If this were legitimate, they'd call for the city watch!
<ce>    They'd do a trial! You need to change your mind.
<ce>    I'll even give you this Mithril Shortsword.
<ce>    Please, tell me you won't kill my friend.

Message:  1013
<ce>       You're making a mistake. A huge mistake.
<ce>    
<ce>    I won't forget this. If I get there first,
<ce>    we'll both be gone. Your name will 
<ce>    be hated for generations.

Message:  1014
%ra, Faustinus is innocent.
Please come to _tavern_ here in town.
<ce>       
                    _pers_

Message:  1015
<ce>   No! They found me!
<ce>    I'll... I'll fight to the death!

Message:  1016
<ce>   Faustinus is dead.
<ce>  Your reward is with the Fighters Guild.

Message:  1017
<ce>   You're back already? What is it?
<ce>   
<ce>   Are you out of your mind?
<ce>   Betrayals, fraud, a false kill order?
<ce>   %pcf, I don't know what's gotten into you,
<ce>   but the Fighters Guild is a professional
<ce>   organization. We take our job and we do it.
<ce>   No getting into the gritty details of things.
<ce>   This order's legitimate, all right?
<ce>   With what you've done, Faustinus will
<ce>   probably be in another town soon,
<ce>   and the %rt's gonna blame us.
<ce>   
<ce>   If you don't wanna do a job, just don't take it, okay?

Message:  1018
<ce>   Thank you. %oth, thank you.
<ce>   I could not believe that someone would trust me,
<ce>   much less a stranger, but this means the world to me.
<ce>   If I ever cross paths with you again, any favor
<ce>   you ask will be yours. Take the shortsword.
<ce>   Please, be safe and well.
