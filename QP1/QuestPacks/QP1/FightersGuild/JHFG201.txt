<ce>          We've got a job for someone experienced like you,
<ce>            %pcf, but I'm not gonna blame you for turning
<ce>          it down. It involves one vampire and no sunlight.
<ce>             You think you can fix that kind of problem?
<ce>                 There's a dwarven pauldron in it for you.
                                     <--->
<ce>         Ever killed a vampire before, %pcf? Not one of them
<ce>       ancients. We've got a request here to floor some simple
<ce>                vampire in a house over in ___place_.
<ce>               Take this one if you feel ready for it.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   I'll look for someone else then.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            So here's the deal. You're headed to  _place_.
<ce>               That'll be in ___place_. Slay the beast
<ce>        and get back here so I can get you your reward.
<ce>         I'm giving you =timer_ days before I send for backup
<ce>             from a temple or something. Good luck, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  You needed to return from slaying
<ce>                   the vampire in ___place_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Excellent work, %pcf. This is why
<ce>                   we count on you. Have your armor.

 The Fighters Guild of
 ___qgiver_ has sent me to
 ___place_ to slay a vampire
 in _place_.  I've got to
 to be back in =timer_ days
 or they'll call for the temple.

Message:  1011
<ce>                      "No!" The vampire shrieks
<ce>                    before crumpling to the floor.

<ce>                 (ATTRIBUTE CHECK FAILED: WILLPOWER)
<ce>
<ce>           The vampire raises her arms and screams, casting
<ce>       a spell in self-defense. It only stuns you for a moment,
<ce>    but it's enough for her to invoke multiple empowering enchantments.
<ce>                     This fight just got harder.
