<ce>           Gotta love some poetic justice. The Mages Guild,
<ce>            right? All high-and-mighty? They have no idea
<ce>           what they're doing sometimes. Just got a request
<ce>                 about how they summoned a daedra and
<ce>                 lost control of it. They came crying
<ce>             to us to fix their problem. All I've got to
<ce>                offer you is this _reward_, which I'll
<ce>                   admit isn't a lot. You in, %pcf?
                                     <--->
<ce>             So, funny story. The Mages Guild goes around
<ce>           all the time with their big, colorful robes and
<ce>             pompous attitudes all the time talking 'bout
<ce>             how great they are, right? Until one of them
<ce>               summons a daedra and they don't know how
<ce>           to get rid of it. Bunch of idiots. They gave me
<ce>              this _reward_, which'll be yours if you go
<ce>                    down into a cave and kill it.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                Well, maybe this'll make those morons
<ce>                 learn some responsibility for once.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>              Fair warning, we already lost some people
<ce>              to this abomination. It's crawling around
<ce>                       in ___dungeon_, probably
<ce>                trying to summon more of its kind. Get
<ce>               back here within =timer_ days, before I
<ce>                 start a fight with the Archmagister.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   _questgiver_'s agreement to slay
<ce>             the daedra for the Mages Guild has expired.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 Someone on the second floor bet you
<ce>                weren't coming back. I made some money
<ce>                off of you today. Here's your payment,
<ce>              just in case it's worth killing a daedra.
