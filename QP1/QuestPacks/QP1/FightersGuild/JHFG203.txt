<ce>    Property dispute. A noble here in %crn
<ce>  wants to expand his mansion, and some
<ce>  rangers in the nearby wilderness are
<ce>  gettin' real testy about it.
<ce>  They're threatening to go ballistic on his
<ce>  place unless he stops his plans.
<ce>  I don't think there's a diplomatic solution
<ce>  to this one, you're gonna have to knock 'em down.
<ce>  Is this your kind of job?

<ce>     The place is ___manor_. I know it'll look tiny,
<ce>  and that's how the rangers want to keep it.
<ce>  They've got power to charm critters,
<ce>  so expect some humans and some animals.
<ce>  Once all the baddies are dead,
<ce>  you'll be paid on the spot.
<ce>  Just make sure you get this done before =timer_ days
<ce>  are up, that place won't last forever.

<ce>  
<ce>  "So shall it be done."

<ce>    There's no hiding your approach to ___manor_.
<ce>  The furious rangers see you coming from afar.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Nature's servants shall do Her bidding!"
<ce>  
<ce>  They split up and try to surround you,
<ce>  calling for aid from some wild animals.

Message:  1011
<ce>  A servant exits the house and surveys the wreckage.
<ce>  After ensuring the danger is gone, he approaches
<ce>  to speak to you.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Hail, great warrior. My master's thanks to you
<ce>  for ridding us of our persecutors.
<ce>  I am authorized to give you these =reward_ gold pieces,
<ce>  but should you so desire, we could instead
<ce>  spread your fame abroad in %crn to give you
<ce>  a better name in the eyes of the law."
<ce>  
<ce>  Do you choose the gold (yes) or the reward of fame (no)?
