QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>    A vampire lord took over a private cemetery
<ce>  with his two wives. Got some kind of harem thing
<ce>  going on, I dunno. I'm not a vampire, don't ask me.
<ce>  The property owner is paying an ebony broadsword
<ce>  to whoever gets rid of them.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>   I get you. Vampires are real nasty folk.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  Head off to ___cem_, which is %di.
<ce>  They're not going to come out into the
<ce>  daylight, obviously, so wait outside until
<ce>  they show up. Make sure they're absolutely
<ce>  dead, or whatever the equivalent of dead
<ce>  is for vampires, and I'll have your
<ce>  sword if you're back within =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 The Fighters Guild sent you to clean
<ce>                        out ___cem_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  Hey, you're getting good at this.
<ce>  When even vampires fall, there's not
<ce>  much else that can scare you.
<ce>    Here you go, with my compliments.

Message:  1010
<ce>  This is the right place, but it's too close to daytime.
<ce>  You'll need to stay around until it's later at night.

Message:  1011
<ce>  You are spotted immediately. Guttural hissing
<ce>  rises into the air as the lord and his
<ce>  consorts move in for the kill.

Message:  1012
<ce>  All three vampires are defeated.
