<ce>                     ___rural_'s been having this
<ce>               problem with wildlife on their property
<ce>                trying to eat people at night. During
<ce>                the day the things are hibernating or
<ce>                something and they can do their work,
<ce>                but anyone outside the premises after
<ce>              dark is in for a big surprise. It's paying
<ce>                  an elven dai-katana and you get a
<ce>                 change of scenery. What do you say?
                                     <--->
<ce>            It's kind of a sad story, but we end up being
<ce>            sort of the city guard for those far-off farm
<ce>                    homes when the %t doesn't care
<ce>                  enough to help them out. You wanna
<ce>               head out to ___rural_ and kill off some
<ce>              wild beasts that are bothering the place?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 Someone else is getting paid, then.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Good. Head out there to ___rural_,
<ce>                sit down on the dirt or something when
<ce>              it's night, and you'll probably pick up a
<ce>              bunch of these beasts fast. Take 'em down
<ce>           and come back here for your payment. You'll know
<ce>          when you're done. Be back in =timer_ days or less.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 The Fighters Guild sent you to clean
<ce>                        out ___rural_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>               Good money, good trip, good experience.
<ce>                 I hope you enjoy these things, %pcf.
<ce>                 Stop and smell the roses some time.
<ce>                  Here's your _reward_.
                                     <--->
<ce>              How was the trip? Too many of our members
<ce>                just want to stay local and kill rats.
<ce>               Good to see some initiative out of you.
<ce>                              Take this.

Message:  1010
<ce>      As the beasts approach the property, you notice a pair of spriggans
<ce>          a ways off. They seem to be watching the creatures,
<ce>        neither interfering with nor helping them.
<ce>         If you knew how to, perhaps you could
<ce>                 ask them to help you kill your prey.
<ce>      Do you ask for their help (yes) or do it on your own (no)?
<ce>
<ce>                  (SKILL CHECK: YES: Spriggan, difficulty low)

Message:  1011
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>           You explain to the spriggans that these animals
<ce>             are harming the cycle of nature by attacking
<ce>               humans, the caretakers of this property.
<ce>           They see the beasts' violent disposition and
<ce>                      march toward you to help.

Message:  1012
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>        You call out to the spriggans and try to convince them
<ce>     to attack the beasts. You attract their attention but don't
<ce>      have the words to explain yourself. They take your shouts
<ce>               to be taunts and step in to attack you.

Message:  1013
<ce>      You'd rather not introduce another unknown into this mess.
<ce>    The spriggans idly watch for a few minutes, and then pass by.

Message:  1020
<ce>              Your work is finished here. You trust the
<ce>           property owners will take care of the clean-up.

Message:  1021
<ce>                    (ATTRIBUTE CHECK PASSED: LUCK)
<ce>
<ce>             You approach the property and see the bears
<ce>      you have to dispose of. As luck would have it, you notice
<ce>    a team of hunters also stalking them. Before you can approach,
<ce>   they rush forward and slay the bears, skinning and gutting them
<ce>              for their own gain. They pay you no heed.
<ce>
<ce>            The bears are dead and you expended no effort.
<ce>             The Fighters Guild can't complain, can they?

<ce>                    (ATTRIBUTE CHECK PASSED: LUCK)
<ce>
<ce>             You approach the property and see the tigers
<ce>      you have to dispose of. As luck would have it, you notice
<ce>    a team of hunters also stalking them. Before you can approach,
<ce>   they rush forward and slay the tigers, skinning and gutting them
<ce>              for their own gain. They pay you no heed.
<ce>
<ce>           The tigers are dead and you expended no effort.
<ce>             The Fighters Guild can't complain, can they?
