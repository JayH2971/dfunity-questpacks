QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>         Got a simple bounty here for one zombie in a house.
<ce>            Just gotta slay it and come for your payment,
<ce>       and you'll have a little help too. Can you handle that?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  Zombies are right pests, I agree.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>      Take this talisman. If at any point in the fight you feel
<ce>       like it's about to take you, wrap your hands around this
<ce>         trinket and press it tight. The zombie should freeze
<ce>              up and let you get ready for more battle.
<ce>      It'll still fight back, but you should get some breathing
<ce>     room from it. Problem is, a talisman only works once before
<ce>    it needs recharging. Come back when the thing's dead and we'll
<ce>            get you a payment, all right? It's in _house_
<ce>          here in town. I want to see you here in 24 hours.
<ce>                          Fight careful now.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 Your twenty-four hours to report on
<ce>                   the zombie's death have expired.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  Here you go then. Silver will knock down any skeleton suckers
<ce>  you face. Believe it!

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Someone hatched a harpy around ___house_, but no one can find it.

QuestorPostSuccess:  [1008]
Now that you've slain that zombie, you're officially ready for the big stuff. What can I get you?

QuestorPostFailure:  [1009]
Hey, don't feel too bad about that zombie. Tough sons of Oblivion, they are.

 A zombie has invaded _house_
 in ___house_, and I need to kill
 it and return within 24 hours. I've been
 given a talisman which can stop it from moving,
 in case the battle gets too tough.

Message:  1011
<ce>                The zombie is dead, and you are alive.
<ce>                Time to return to the Fighters Guild.

Message:  1012
<ce>         Well done! Those things scare most people to death.
<ce>        You've got a future with us, I think. Let me take back
<ce>                 that talisman. Now, are you more the kind to fight with
<ce>                     a mace, or with a longsword?
<ce>     
<ce>     (YES: Mace; NO: Longsword)
