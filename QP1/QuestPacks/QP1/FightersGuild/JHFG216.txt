<ce>         Hey %pcf, let me tell you about this one in secret.
<ce>         I wish it didn't come to this, but it's gotta happen
<ce>        every once in a while. The guild's got a member who's
<ce>        into some really shady business, stuff that shouldn't
<ce>          touch our good name. The problem is that the fool
<ce>            hasn't broken any actual rules so we've got to
<ce>          put up with this bad behavior. But if someone from
<ce>        out here went over there to take care of the problem,
<ce>         everyone would be a lot happier, right? Can I count
<ce>                   on you for something like this?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>         Just do me a favor and don't tell anyone, all right?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            All right then, be quick and be quiet. Get to
<ce>                ___fg_. With any luck you'll find our
<ce>             former friend in the guild hall over there.
<ce>           Just be done with it quickly and come back here.
<ce>          This is an official guild job so you're gonna get
<ce>        paid a Dwarven Warhammer, but we do some complicated writing
<ce>             to make sure you're free of blame. Come back
<ce>                  in =timer_ days when you're done.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>       _qgiver_ asked you to eliminate the rogue member by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 Anyone over there put up a fuss? No?
<ce>                 Proof's in the pudding, as they say.
<ce>                Here's your reward. Your secret's safe.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The merchants are going to strike if the %t increases their taxes again.

Message:  1020
