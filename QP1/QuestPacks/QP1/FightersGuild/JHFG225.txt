QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                The Mages Guild is looking for someone
<ce>                to go rescue one of their own that got
<ce>                lost out in some cave. It'll pay like
<ce>              any other job and you'll get in good with
<ce>                     them and us. Wanna take it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                Yeah, they're a pretty pompous bunch.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      Head on down to ___dung_.
<ce>              I'll mark it on your map. If you can bring
<ce>                    _scholar_ here in =timer_ days
<ce>                I'll have =reward_ gold for you. Don't
<ce>                    worry about whatever the mage
<ce>                  was doing. Your one job is to get
<ce>                  %g2 and yourself back here alive.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  I see you, but where's _scholar_?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Hey, _scholar_, glad to see
<ce>                   you above ground! I'm _qgiver_.
<ce>               %pcf and I are from the Fighters Guild.
<ce>                You head on back home and remember who
<ce>                     kept you safe, you hear now?
<ce>
<ce>                   Great job getting the job done.
<ce>                These people have families, you know.
<ce>                     I wish I could pay you more.

<ce>                    Who's there?! %oth. Well met,
<ce>                  %pct. I have spent weeks searching
<ce>                 for a missing atronach fruitlessly.
<ce>                  The hideous creature has probably
<ce>                    long departed this foul hole.
<ce>                    Yes, it's high time we return
<ce>                to the civilized world. Lead the way.

<ce>                  Who's there?! %oth. Well met, %ra.
<ce>                    I have been here far too long.
<ce>                    I've convinced myself that the
<ce>                      _dummy_ I was sent to find
<ce>                    does not exist at all. Please,
<ce>                 lead the way to the civilized world.
                                     <--->
<ce>                       Aha! Oh. Well met, %ra.
<ce>                   Did the Mages Guild send you to
<ce>                    search for a lost scroll too?
<ce>                   Oh, a recall order. Well, I can
<ce>                   do that too. Show me the way to
<ce>                        the exit, good friend.
                                     <--->
<ce>                   Ho! Good day, friend. I've been
<ce>                   searching for weeks for a mummy
<ce>                    possessing superlatively fresh
<ce>                wrappings, and simply cannot find it.
<ce>                The Mages Guild likely has no further
<ce>                    use for them at this point, to
<ce>                    be honest. I agree, we should
<ce>                    find a way out of this place.

<ce>                    (ATTRIBUTE CHECK PASSED: LUCK)
<ce>
<ce>            As luck would have it, the scholar is near the
<ce>                entrance to ___dung_. _scholar_ says,
<ce>
<ce>                  "Are you from the Fighters Guild?
<ce>           Oh my! I just now found the exit and wondered if
<ce>           I had the courage to make it on my own. Please,
<ce>                     lead the way to ___qgiver_!"
