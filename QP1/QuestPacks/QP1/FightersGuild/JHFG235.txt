<ce>                      Some idiot in town thought
<ce>          he'd try to raise his grandparents from the dead.
<ce>     I mean, I get the feeling, and we miss our families, right?
<ce>          But now they're a pair of angry skeletons walking
<ce>         around the house, and he's paying money to get them
<ce>                   dead... again. Interested, %pcf?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 I don't blame you, skeletons are not
<ce>                        as easy as they sound.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               You're looking for _place_, which is...
<ce>                    um, %di. Yeah, now I remember.
<ce>             You're gonna find both skeletons inside, and
<ce>               you'll get paid when they're both dead.
<ce>             We normally charge less for a local job, but
<ce>             he really wanted it to be done in 24 hours,
<ce>          so that's your time limit. This is worth =reward_
<ce>                gold pieces for you. Also, I'm hoping
<ce>           you've got a blunt weapon or something, because
<ce>                 blades don't do jack to solid bone.
<ce>        Might want to stop by the store if you feel confident
<ce>             holding one. Anyway, that's enough from me.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  You needed to return from slaying
<ce>                   the skeletons in _place_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Excellent work, %pcf. This is why
<ce>                   we count on you. Have your gold.

%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild of
 ___qgiver_ has sent me to
 _place_ to kill two skeletons.
 I have 24 hours to return for
 =reward_ gold pieces.

Message:  1011
<ce>                   You've destroyed both skeletons.
<ce>           The client probably won't be messing around with
<ce>               necromancy any more after this incident.

<ce>                  (ATTRIBUTE CHECK FAILED: AGILITY)
<ce>
<ce>         One of the dangers of fighting multiple foes is that
<ce>    you risk being stabbed in the back. With unique intelligence,
<ce>      one of the skeletons finds an opportunity to do just that.
