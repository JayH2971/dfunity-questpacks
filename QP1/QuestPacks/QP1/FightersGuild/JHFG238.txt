QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  We've got an order from the %rt telling us to get rid
<ce>  of some member of the Thieves Guild here in town.
<ce>  Hangs out in a shop, I guess as a cover story.
<ce>  It doesn't pay much, but it's pretty easy.
<ce>  Want it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>     You're not afraid of the Thieves Guild, are you %pct?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>     Great! I was worried about this one.
<ce>  Glad to get someone on it.
<ce>  I'm signing the order now, which means
<ce>  you've got 24 hours to get to _res_
<ce>  and kill this thief, whoever he or she is.
<ce>  Probably gonna be pretty easy to spot.
<ce>  Just get back in one piece, I'll have _gold_
<ce>  gold pieces here for you, straight from the %rt.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    Your contract to slay the thief
<ce>                        in _res_ has gone delinquent.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>        Yeah, the Thieves Guild aren't much
<ce>  of fighters. If they'd just come on over we could
<ce>  teach 'em how to brawl, but you know how it is.
<ce>  Underworld temptations and all that.
<ce>  Well, enough rambling. Here's your gold.

Message:  1010
<ce>   You hear rustling and some nervous talk.
<ce>  Your presence here is definitely noticed.

Message:  1011
<ce>     The thief is slain, and you are yet alive.
