QRC:

Message:  1010
<ce> Inside the guild hall, you are given a letter.
<ce> You open it at once. The crude writing is that of a child:
<ce> 
"hello
<ce> 
"thank you for saving me from that cave and those bad people.
im going to join the fiters gild when i grow up just
like you and kill lots of crimanols. my mom wont let
me swing a sword yet but i wont tell her."
<ce> 
<ce> The child apparently forgot to sign the letter.
<ce> You have become a role model for someone, it seems.
