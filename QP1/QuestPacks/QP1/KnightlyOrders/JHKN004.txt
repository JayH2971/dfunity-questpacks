QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>          %pcn, I do not know if you have heard the rumors.
<ce>         Allow me to explain the situation. Some outlaw band
<ce>         of renegade warriors, the Knights of the _gem_, are
<ce>        attempting to gain legitimacy for themselves by taking
<ce>          an entire city by force, that is, ___questgiver_.
<ce>              The forces of %crn have stomped out a few
<ce>         their encampments, but they have escaped us, and now
<ce>       word has come that a full assault will soon be upon us.
<ce>          Will you stand watch with me to see whether these
<ce>                     things are so, good knight?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                Then go quickly, %pcf. I don't want a
<ce>              coward to die in the impending bloodshed.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     Very good. Stand here until
<ce>                         they bring us word.

<ce>                  A page bearing the banner of %crn
<ce>                    draws near and bows before you
<ce>                    before reading from a scroll.
<ce>
<ce>                 "%pcn, Knight Protectorate of %crn,
<ce>               we salute the service you have performed
<ce>            this day, bringing swift justice to renegades
<ce>            and outlaws who put this city into peril. May
<ce>                  %god be with you in your endeavors
<ce>                to preserve justice and civilization."
<ce>
<ce>            Others begin to move and clean up the bodies.
<ce>         The assault is over, and life can resume once more.

<ce>                  As the first of the outlaws falls,

<ce>
<ce>                   "Kill them all! This is the day

<ce>          The spellswords must be here to defend ___palace_.

%qdt:
 It seems all-out war has broken
 out between the forces of
 %crn and some renegade
 group of knight pretenders
 called the Knights of the _gem_
 in the city of ___palace_.
 I must defend the town as well
 as I can for my own part.

Message:  1031

 The guards have told me to hurry
 to the _palace_ in ___palace_,
 as it appears the invaders
 have entered it.
