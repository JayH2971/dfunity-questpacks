<ce>            My %pct, we have a task which would ordinarily
<ce>          go only to our squires in training. Were there not
<ce>          some element of danger involved, I would not waste
<ce>             my breath nor your time. The law requires an
<ce>           object of evidence in a recent murder, which the
<ce>            town guard neglected to recover at the time of
<ce>        the arrest. Since this matter involves a serial killer
<ce>             and multiple cities, jurisdiction belongs to
<ce>                      %crn, and the %t has asked
<ce>          for our assistance. Will you recover the evidence?

<ce>              Then be off with you. Search for some more
<ce>              noble purpose than administering justice.

<ce>                    Good. The _clothes_ will be in
<ce>                    ___res_, inside a house called
<ce>                 _res_, which is watched by the city
<ce>                guard. Should any of them question you
<ce>                upon entry, merely state your name and
<ce>              affiliation. Once you have it, return here
<ce>            quickly. The rogue acted in concert with some
<ce>               accomplices, such that we have suspicion
<ce>               of some manner of violent intervention.
<ce>              Be here within =timer_ days, and no later.
<ce>            The trial cannot be delayed further by halfwit
<ce>                    assistance. %god be with you.

<ce>            Not a moment too late, %pcf, for the trial has
<ce>           been expedited. This _clothes_ and the testimony
<ce>            of the witnesses will surely bring justice to
<ce>                      %crn tomorrow. Well done.

<ce>           Reliability on all matters, small and great, is
<ce>        worthy of a hero. I thank you for making the journey.

<ce>                 Excellent, %pct. We can now expedite
<ce>                the trial. Superb work on all counts.

<ce>                 Your foes' courage begins to falter.
<ce>          One shouts to the other, "Hey, this one's a freak!
<ce>                      We gotta get out of here!"
<ce>
<ce>              Your foes flee before you tear them apart.
<ce>               You assume your return journey will have
<ce>                      no further interruptions.

<ce>           Someone less skilled would not have noticed the
<ce>          sigils written about the doorpost. You stealthily
<ce>                     step in, avoiding detection.
