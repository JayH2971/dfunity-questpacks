QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  My name is _qgiver_. This morning
<ce>              we received a courier on behalf of the %t
<ce>                    requesting aid in ___dungeon_.
<ce>               Apparently there's a nest of dragonlings
<ce>                   somewhere inside of a rare breed
<ce>                   worth protecting. Poachers have
<ce>                   already begun entering, and it's
<ce>                     only a matter of time before
<ce>                there are no dragonlings left at all.
<ce>                  Will you offer your hand in this?

<ce>                            A poor answer.

<ce>                      The %t has made abundantly
<ce>                 clear that this activity is illegal.
<ce>                  You are authorized to put to death
<ce>                 any who attempt it further. Hurry to
<ce>                    ___dungeon_ and make clear the
<ce>                  intent of our good ruler. I expect
<ce>                 this to be resolved in =timer_ days.
<ce>                            Go now, %pcf.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    _qgiver_ expected your report
<ce>                  regarding the dragonlings by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                      Excellent work. Let no one
<ce>                    disobey the %t with impunity.

<ce>                      The message has been made
<ce>                   abundantly clear. These corpses
<ce>                    will serve as a warning to any
<ce>                      others who trespass here.

<ce>                     You get the sinking feeling
<ce>                      that this is not what you
<ce>                         were supposed to do.

Message:  1022
<ce>           Slow down, knight thug. We're more trouble than
<ce>           you can handle. My buddies and me are gonna find
<ce>           this dragon whether you like it or not, so I'll
<ce>           make it easy. Here's =bribe_ gold pieces if you
<ce>                          leave us in peace.
                                     <--->
<ce>           Think fast, knight. I've got =bribe_ gold pieces
<ce>            for you if you look the other way and leave my
<ce>              buddies and me alone. We need that dragon,
<ce>                     over your dead body or not.
