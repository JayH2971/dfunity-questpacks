QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  A recent raid on an orc encampment
<ce>                      in ___dung_ proved timely.
<ce>                 We are informed that the brutes have
<ce>               planned an assassination attempt against
<ce>                  _noble_, a noble within the region
<ce>                  of %crn. We must prevent this work
<ce>               of destabilization, and the time is far
<ce>                too short to rally the host of knights
<ce>                this matter deserves. Will you go and
<ce>                    do the work of an army, %pct?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    If you hear of _noble_'s death
<ce>               in the next few weeks, you'll be able to
<ce>             tell your friends you knew of it beforehand.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Move quickly. _noble_ will be at the
<ce>                 palace in ___palace_. We expect the
<ce>                attack to occur in the night hours in
<ce>          =2palace_ days. Tell me the tale when you return.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 Loud screams emanate from within the
<ce>             palace, followed by a joyful roar. You need
<ce>                 not look to know what has happened.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                        _noble_ is led away by
<ce>                 armed guards. A page speaks to you.
<ce>
<ce>                "%pcn, if all knights in %crn are like
<ce>             yourself, we have no further need for fear.
<ce>          Perhaps next they will send you to capture Gortwog
<ce>            himself. Your name will be had in open renown
<ce>          across the land if you remain faithful to the %t."

Message:  1010
<ce>               Two palace servants spy you from across
<ce>             the hall and duck out of view. No doubt they
<ce>               will have some well-planned escape route
<ce>               in case their fears are brought to pass.

Message:  1011
<ce>                     (SKILL CHECK PASSED: ORCISH)
<ce>
<ce>            You hear the orcs begin to enter the building.
<ce>                Deepening your voice, you roar at them
<ce>           to cease the attack and flee. Mistaking you for
<ce>          one of their leaders, the orcs abandon their plan
<ce>                    and scurry out of ___palace_.
<ce>               Nearby servants stare in wonder at your
<ce>                   mastery of the Orcish language.

Message:  1015
<ce>                 You hear savage roaring from within
<ce>              the palace. The attack has already begun.

Message:  1018
<ce>              This is the night the orcs plan to attack
<ce>                      the palace in ___palace_.

Message:  1020
<ce>              You step into the palace and are met by a
<ce>                 frightful servant. The air is tense.
<ce>
<ce>               "The report was false! We are deceived!
<ce>                  They have taken my master _noble_!
<ce>               The court magician says they are headed
<ce>                   for ___dung2_. Please help %g2!"

Message:  1021
<ce>            Please! Save me from these horrible creatures!
<ce>                        %oth, how I hate orcs!
                                     <--->
<ce>          %god be praised! Free me from this place, please!

Message:  1022
<ce>                   _noble_ suddenly bends over and
<ce>        retches. Out of respect you look away until it's over.
<ce>
<ce>                "%oth, forgive me. This hole is doing
<ce>          worse things unto me by the minute. Please, get me
<ce>         out of here. I don't think I can last a couple more
<ce>       hours before my condition will become life-threatening."

Message:  1023
<ce>                _noble_ suddenly drops to the ground.
<ce>          Your best attempts to resuscitate %g2 are in vain.
<ce>                 The filthiness within ___dung2_ has
<ce>                            overcome %g2.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 I must hurry to ___palace_
 to thwart an orcish attack to
 occur in =2palace_ days. I should wait
 in the palace during the night hours
 to prevent an attack on
 _noble_, who waits inside.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 The servants of the palace at
 ___palace_ informed me that
 _noble_ has been taken
 away to ___dung2_ by the orcs.
 I should find %g2 and return %g2
 to the palace.

Message:  1035
<ce>                     Abdicating _noble_ when %g1
<ce>               most needed you will reflect very poorly
<ce>                  on yourself and the other knights.
