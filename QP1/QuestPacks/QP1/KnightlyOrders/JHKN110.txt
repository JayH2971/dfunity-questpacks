QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  A demon from Oblivion has taken up residence in a ruined castle
<ce>  and caused great havoc of late to local citizenry. If you have
<ce>  means of harming daedrakind, we request that you take up this matter.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>        Not a task to be taken lightly, I agree.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  ___dung_ is the name of the place. Find it that way, %di.
<ce>  This daedraling will defend itself, but the task falls to you
<ce>  to destroy it. We don't care how, so long as it is dead.
<ce>  Have done with the task within =timer_ days, presenting yourself
<ce>  here as proof.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  You were to destroy the daedra and return to __questgiver_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  A trap was laid, you say? I'm glad we sent someone capable
<ce>  enough to survive it. A good knight is hard to come by.
<ce>  The people of %crn salute you, %pct.

Message:  1010
<ce>    The daedra emits a roar as it presses upon you.

Message:  1011
<ce>  The demon falls, but it points at you. A vision enters your mind,
<ce>  in which you see yourself falling dead within these ruins.
<ce>  
<ce>  "In two hours... you will join me..." the daedra laughs as it falls inert.
<ce>  
<ce>  Its enchantment bursts forth, and you feel foul power bind to you.
<ce>  If you can escape ___dung_ before the time is up, perhaps
<ce>  you can be saved yet.

Message:  1012
<ce>  You notice some kind of energy force in these ruins.
<ce>  The daedra must have been at work while you traveled here.

Message:  1013
<ce>  ATTRIBUTE CHECK FAILED: ENDURANCE
<ce>  
<ce>  Alas, two hours have passed and you are yet inside.
<ce>  Your body is twisted with excruciating pain,
<ce>  which you cannot survive. __questgiver_ will
<ce>  plan an extravagant funeral for you.

Message:  1014
<ce>  ATTRIBUTE CHECK SUCCEEDED: ENDURANCE
<ce>  
<ce>  Alas, two hours have passed and you are yet inside.
<ce>  Your body is twisted with excruciating pain,
<ce>  which you barely survive. A weaker soul would
<ce>  have died instantly.

Message:  1015
<ce>  You are free of the castle ruins, and no foul curse has
<ce>  befallen you. It looks like the daedra's prophecy failed.

%qdt:
 __questgiver_ has assigned
