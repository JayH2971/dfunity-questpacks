QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  The %t rarely offers a reward for our tasks,
<ce>  much less a monetary one. Nevertheless, one knight
<ce>  stands to gain ten thousand gold coins for a
<ce>  death-defying dive into some depths.
<ce>  An ancient lich must be destroyed, and it has cursed
<ce>  its lair to slay any intruder who has spent
<ce>  twelve hours within. Your skill must only be exceeded
<ce>  by your speed if you will undertake this, %pct.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  I much prefer my knights to be alive. A good choice.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  I will mark ___dung_ on your map. Find the foe within.
<ce>  If you must rest, do so outside the cave. Should you spend
<ce>  twelve hours within, you will fall with no hope of restoration.
<ce>  The %t will reclaim the reward after =timer_ days have passed,
<ce>  so you must be certain of your travel. Return alive, please.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  You were to destroy the lich and return to __questgiver_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  Upon hearing of your success,
<ce>  _questgiver_ claps %g3 hands, and ten thousand gold coins
<ce>  are presented to you. A moment of congratulatory silence passes.
<ce>  
<ce>  "I can say nothing more. You are truly a knight worth honoring.
<ce>  Your name merits great praise."

Message:  1010
<ce>    The lich continues channeling its curse, but nevertheless turns to fight you.

Message:  1011
<ce>  The undead mage finally falls, and all the energy surrounding you dissipates.
<ce>  You are free of its curse, as is this cave.

Message:  1012
<ce>  Dark whisperings fill your ears. The lich must be hard at work.
<ce>  You feel a corrosive energy bind to you, slowly but surely.

Message:  1013
<ce>  The air around you continues accumulating miasma of some kind.
<ce>  Breathing becomes difficult, and occasionally your sight is blurry.
<ce>  You have spent four hours inside ___dung_.

Message:  1014
<ce>  Your joints ache and your muscles burn. Everything is a chore now.
<ce>  You have spent eight hours inside ___dung_. Some adventurers
<ce>  would question whether to continue this pursuit.

Message:  1015
<ce>  All of a sudden, a tiny shift happens.
<ce>  All the miasma that surrounded you converges.
<ce>  It invades your body and forces everything to stop,
<ce>  including your heart, brain, and lungs.
<ce>  Your death is instantaneous and painless.

Message:  1016
<ce>  While outside, you can still feel the energy
<ce>  upon you, but it isn't increasing. You can rest safely out here.

%qdt:
 I am to be paid ten thousand gold coins
 through __questgiver_ if I can defeat the ancient lich
 that haunts ___dung_. I must return to
 ___questgiver_ and report my success within =timer_ days.
 I can only spend twelve hours within the depths.
