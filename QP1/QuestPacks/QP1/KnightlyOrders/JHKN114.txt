QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>           Our help is requested in settling a debt dispute
<ce>         among family members. It'll take a bit of traveling
<ce>      and some judgment, but this matter is as important as any
<ce>                  other. Will you take up the cause?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          Very well, I'll look for something more perilous.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                 Good. Speak to _owner_ in __owner_.
<ce>                  You'll be sent off to another town
<ce>                in order to rectify the debt problem.
<ce>              I don't know the details, but I trust that
<ce>          whatever comes of it, you'll provide a good moral
<ce>                  example in the face of opposition.
<ce>     Return here in =timer_ days when all parties are dealt with.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>          _questgiver_ of __questgiver_ needed you to report
<ce>               your success resolving the debt by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>     You didn't expect being a knight could be so heartwrenching,
<ce> did you %pcf? We wish all our acts were filled with glory and honor,
<ce>  but every great knight carries a legacy of sad, difficult choices.
<ce>    The best we can do is strive for integrity and righteousness.
<ce>      We thank you for going out and pushing this matter along.

 _questgiver_ of __questgiver_
 in ___questgiver_ has sent
 me to settle a debt problem among
 family members. I am to speak to
 _owner_ within __owner_
 for more details.
 I have =timer_ days to give my
 report on the matter.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
_owner_ requires me to speak with %g3
in-laws, who live in ___debtor_,
at __debtor_. I should be able to
find someone named _debtor_ there.

Message:  1012
%qdt:
I refused to take the house deed from
_debtor_. There must be some other
way to resolve this. I will report
my doings to _owner_ and return
to __questgiver_.

Message:  1013
%qdt:
I have taken the house deed from
_debtor_ in consequence of the
family's outstanding debts.
I will deliver it to _owner_
and return to __questgiver_.

Message:  1020
<ce>             Eh? Knights? Ah, yes. Thank you for coming.
<ce>
<ce>             A year ago, I loaned a large sum of money to
<ce>          my in-laws over in ___debtor_. The total was over
<ce>            =dummy_ thousand gold pieces, to help them pay
<ce>        for their house. They promised to return the money to
<ce>               me by last month, and I am empty-handed.
<ce>       I am entangled in commitments for the next several weeks
<ce>         and need someone to go in my stead, someone who can
<ce>                 get my money by any means possible.
<ce>          You'll look for _debtor_ in __debtor_, ___debtor_.
<ce>       Speak with %g2 and ensure that this matter is resolved.
<ce>       I hate to lean toward bloodshed, but with every passing
<ce>        day I grow more incensed, and soon will not be able to
<ce>       restrain myself. Help me avert my base desires, knight.
<ce>                         %god speed thy path.

Message:  1021
<ce>             "Hello? __questgiver_? On behalf of _owner_?
<ce>
<ce>        "Oh my, oh %god, we're in trouble. We spent %g3 money.
<ce>       The whole house took ill, three of us died, and we used
<ce>     that gold for their funeral expenses. Now that we're missing
<ce>  my pa's labor and my brother's courier profits, we're more in debt
<ce>      than ever. Please, don't do this to us. Our last material
<ce>          good is this house, and if you take that from us,
<ce>                 we'll never recover. Please, knight,
<ce>          tell _owner_ that this is too much to ask. I don't
<ce>            know the solution, but it isn't that. Please,
<ce>          leave us the deed to the house. I'm begging you."
<ce>
<ce>          If you extend them mercy, _owner_ will be furious.
<ce>         But if you take the deed to the house, these people
<ce>     will lose everything. _debtor_ looks at you with tear-filled
<ce>     eyes. Will you take the deed to the house as collateral for
<ce>                     _owner_'s outstanding debt?

Message:  1022
<ce>    You tell _debtor_ that you will seek forbearance on the loan.
<ce>      Weeping, %g1 falls at your feet and thanks you profusely.
<ce>     You know _owner_ will refuse to accept this, but you cannot
<ce>     stake your honor on throwing these people out of their home.
<ce>        You'll need to tell %g2 about this before returning to
<ce>                            __questgiver_.

Message:  1023
<ce>       Hard as it may be for them, you must fulfill your task.
<ce>      You demand the house deed, and _debtor_ tearfully delivers
<ce>           it to you. You put it among your possessions and
<ce>           take your leave as the family starts to pack up
<ce>            what few possessions they can carry with them.

Message:  1024
<ce>          Before you can finish the first sentence, _owner_
<ce>          is outraged at your failure to settle the matter.
<ce>        Trinkets, silverware, and jewelry fly across the room
<ce>   as %g1 screams furiously. After ordering you to leave the house,
<ce>         %g1 grabs a weapon and heads outside, presumably to
<ce>                    settle the matter on his own.
<ce>
<ce>    Times like these try your moral conviction. All that's left is
<ce>                to report the matter to _questgiver_,
<ce>        hoping that the order will see the matter as you did.

Message:  1025
<ce>         _owner_'s face beams as you produce the house deed.
<ce>
<ce>      "__questgiver_ is worth its weight, I see! Fantastic work!
<ce>  I shall call the knights true men of honor from this day forward.
<ce>     I'm glad you did not falter in the face of whatever excuses
<ce>        they put to you. I hate to do this to my in-laws, but
<ce>     had you failed, others would have suffered as a consequence.
<ce>         Send my blessing to _questgiver_ and __questgiver_."

Message:  1027
