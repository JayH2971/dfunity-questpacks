<ce>                  Sparse regions of %crn complain of
<ce>                spriggans attacking their homesteads.
<ce>                  Evidence suggests the cause may be
<ce>                         within ___dung_. Can
<ce>                 we rely on you to stop this problem?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   Now you're looking for a simple
<ce>                     problem to solve, I suppose?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  So often when this happens, it is
<ce>                some fool who has let power get to his
<ce>                  head and starts trying to display
<ce>                   that power to the world. We wish
<ce>                  such could enlist to a noble cause
<ce>                    and put their zeal toward good
<ce>                    purposes, but some are simply
<ce>                    too obstinate. Do your best to
<ce>                    defend against the spriggans.
<ce>                 Perhaps if you speak their language
<ce>               you'll make some headway in some manner
<ce>                 or another. Resolve the cause within
<ce>                   =2dung_ days, and then return to
<ce>                     report at your leisure. %god
<ce>                      go with you into ___dung_.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   You were to resolve the cause of
<ce>                   the attacking spriggans by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 Resourceful, skilled, and diligent.
<ce>                  A model for knights of this order.

Message:  1020
<ce>                  A spriggan shambles its way toward
<ce>                 you, only half conscious of its own
<ce>                      actions. You could try to
<ce>                talk to it, to see if you can find out
<ce>                    anything that could help you.
<ce>                  Do you try to talk to it (yes) or
<ce>                        try to avoid it (no)?
<ce>
<ce>                  (SKILL CHECK: YES: Spriggan, difficulty low)

<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>               You catch the creature's attention with
<ce>              a greeting and tell it you intend no harm.
<ce>        It responds, in broken language, that its kind suffers
<ce>          a burning agony beyond their control. It promises
<ce>              to inform its kin that you are no danger.
<ce>              You hope it can make good on that promise.
<ce>              You dismiss it, and it wanders elsewhere.

<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>              Whatever you know of the Spriggan language
<ce>          is not enough. Your speech incenses the creature,
<ce>                    and it wanders off in a rage.
<ce>
<ce>           If spriggans are as communal as the stories say,
<ce>            this bodes poorly for your visit to ___dung_.

Message:  1023
<ce>                This sorceror, reeking of green herbs,
<ce>                  appears to have been the cause of
<ce>                       the spriggans' madness.

Message:  1024
<ce>              The poor creature hobbles about in agony.
<ce>          It looks at you momentarily, and then turns about
<ce>            and departs. Perhaps you could have helped it,
<ce>                 but spriggans can be temperamental.

Message:  1025
<ce>             As soon as you cross the threshold, you hear
<ce>                   the angry groaning of spriggans.
<ce>               You hope they won't harass you too much
<ce>           while you search for the source of the problem.
