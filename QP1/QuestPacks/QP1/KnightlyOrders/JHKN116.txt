<ce>                The orcs are brutal creatures, as all
<ce>                 %crn will agree. Very rarely one or
<ce>               another rises up with a brain surpassing
<ce>                 the size of a grapefruit, wishing to
<ce>                 negotiate for a peaceful concession
<ce>                of lands or other territories in which
<ce>                  its people may live. Such requests
<ce>                are always suspect, but we entrust one
<ce>                of them to you. Perhaps you may find a
<ce>                way to do some good on this occasion.

<ce>                           Or perhaps not.

<ce>                   The creature has been allocated
<ce>                          _res_ in ___res_.
<ce>                You should arrive within =2res_ days,
<ce>                 but it goes without saying that the
<ce>                  family that owns the house wishes
<ce>                the matter to be resolved immediately.
<ce>                 No matter what happens, do not slay
<ce>                 the orc within. They may be a filthy
<ce>                 and cunning race of beasts, but they
<ce>                   will use a death of their own to
<ce>                   further their barbarous causes.
<ce>                   Present this _trink_, which was
<ce>                   previously agreed to be the sign
<ce>                   for our negotiator. What happens
<ce>                    from there will be your matter
<ce>                              to handle.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               The orc warlord lies dead at your feet.
<ce>                Its tribe now has even greater reason
<ce>                      to raid the local region.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Well done, %pct. You have found peace
<ce>               amidst tension. Remember that to prevent
<ce>                    war is nobler than to wage it.

Message:  1019
<ce>                  You hear deep, throaty chuckling.
<ce>                The orc is inside and waiting for you.

Message:  1021
<ce>                        (ORCISH CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>                    You present the _trink_ to the
<ce>                 orc. It takes it and crushes it with
<ce>                 one hand, tossing its remains to the
<ce>             floor. The green warrior then begins to ask
<ce>              questions. You answer vaguely, making sure
<ce>                 not to promise anything the %t would
<ce>                  not grant. It makes several brusk
<ce>                 accusations concerning the %t, %crn,
<ce>              and the filthy %ra in its presence before
<ce>                  gradually calming down. Seeing no
<ce>              opportunity to make headway, the creature
<ce>                 ceases speaking and waves you away.
<ce>                 You suppose this counts as success.

Message:  1023
<ce>                        (ORCISH CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>                    You present the _trink_ to the
<ce>                orc, not sure how to proceed. It takes
<ce>               it and crushes it with one hand, tossing
<ce>              its remains to the floor. The warrior then
<ce>             begins to ask questions, first roughly, then
<ce>                mockingly. Once it realizes you speak
<ce>            very little of its language, it pulls out its
<ce>            weapon and decides to take a chance for sport.

Message:  1024
<ce>           The orc is perplexed at your insistence against
<ce>               fighting. It shouts several confused and
<ce>             incomprehensible statements, getting worked
<ce>             up before gradually calming down. It appears
<ce>               to feel guilty about fighting a foe who
<ce>                refuses to raise a defense. Seeing no
<ce>              opportunity to make headway, the creature
<ce>                 ceases speaking and waves you away.
<ce>                 You suppose this counts as success.

Message:  1025
<ce>             You hear the orc erupt into booming laughter
<ce>          within the residence, and then dragging footsteps
<ce>           lead away in a different direction. Whatever you
<ce>       were supposed to negotiate appears not to have happened.
