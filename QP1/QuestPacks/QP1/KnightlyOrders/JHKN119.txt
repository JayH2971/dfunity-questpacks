DisplayName: Rite of Vampire Dispelling

QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>    For too long, we have allowed vampires to maintain
<ce>    dominion over one of %crn's cemeteries. We have enlisted
<ce>    one of the local priests for a powerful rite that will
<ce>    slay them all. A knight must provide protection
<ce>    while the rite is invoked. Will you prove your fearlessness?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>    We cannot delay in removing these parasites.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>     I knew you would not turn us down. You are to find
<ce>    the priest, a =priest_ named _priest_,
<ce>    in _temple_ here in the city. Together, journey toward
<ce>    ___graveyard_ and allow %g2 to do %g3 work.
<ce>    The rite can only happen at night, to have maximum
<ce>    effect upon the hemophiles. Keep _priest_ safe,
<ce>    and whatever spoils you gain from the vampires are yours.
<ce>    Do not delay more than =timer_ days in arriving.
<ce>    %god keep you safe from their grasp. 

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>    _priest_ looks thoroughly disappointed.
<ce>    
<ce>    "We are well past the time appointed to dispatch the vampires!
<ce>    I cannot be a part of this!"
<ce>    
<ce>    After the outburst, %g1 marches off alone.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>     Suddenly, a beam of light shoots from _priest_'s body
<ce>    up into the sky. It begins to expand outward,
<ce>    gradually covering the area. You hear the vampires shrieking
<ce>    and attempting to cover themselves, but it's too late.
<ce>    Soon they collapse into inert heaps, unable to withstand
<ce>    the holy power.
<ce>   
<ce>   "We've done it!" _priest_ shouts, collapsing
<ce>   into an exhausted heap on the ground.
<ce>   You watch %g2 rest a few moments  before %g1 regains his footing.
<ce>   "Yes, we've slain all of them. This hive of nightcrawlers
<ce>   is done with! I can make my way back to ___temple_ on my own.
<ce>   Take your spoils from among their belongings.
<ce>   Let that, with %god's praise, be your reward."
<ce>   
<ce>   The loot is yours. However, it seems the bodies will decay soon.
<ce>   You won't want to waste time collecting any goods you wish to take.

Message:  1010
<ce>    Hello! %oth, I've been terribly nervous about all this.
<ce>    Haven't slept in two days, just thinking about what
<ce>    we have to do. Vampires, of all things! %god keep us safe,
<ce>    for no one else can. The rite has to begin near the hours
<ce>    of midnight, so if we arrive too soon or too late,
<ce>    we'll need to camp inside ___graveyard_.
<ce>    You lead the way, and I'll follow at a safe distance.

Message:  1011
<ce>    This is ___graveyard_, but you'll have to wait
<ce>   until closer to midnight to perform the rite.
<ce>   
<ce>   "We can camp here," _priest_ says.
<ce>   "The vampires won't assault us until
<ce>   we pose a threat to them... I think."

Message:  1012
<ce>   "Yes! We can begin now," _priest_ says.
<ce>   "Just make absolutely sure that you do not leave
<ce>   the cemetery grounds under any circumstances.
<ce>   This will take a while, and both our lives are
<ce>   in your hands. Pray to %god for our survival!"
<ce>   
<ce>   With that, %g1 kneels on the floor and begins
<ce>   chanting and calling. Sensing the mounting danger,
<ce>   vampires begin to crawl out to stop you.

Message:  1013
<ce>   _priest_'s body begins to glow.
<ce>   The rite is starting to take effect.
<ce>   Sensing the danger, more vampires begin to arrive.

Message:  1014
<ce>   Some of the vampires have begun to succumb
<ce>   to the effects of _priest_'s spell.
<ce>   The intensity of the rite continues to mount.

Message:  1015
<ce>   "We're almost there! Keep at it!"
<ce>   _priest_ shouts, %g3 body glowing brightly.

Message:  1016
<ce>   You have strayed too far from ___graveyard_,
<ce>   leaving _priest_ without protection.
<ce>   The vampires mercilessly descend on %g2 and
<ce>   shred %g2 to pieces.
