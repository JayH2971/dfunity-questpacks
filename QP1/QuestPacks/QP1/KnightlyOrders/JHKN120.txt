QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>    A regional city needs to root out some problematic criminals.
<ce>     They need someone to go in from the outside. Are you willing
<ce>                  to be an accomplice to the scheme?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               And why not? What repulses you about it?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>     That's the spirit. Take this paper. It has some sort of code
<ce>     statement that will make the criminals believe you a friend.
<ce>        Speak those words in a populated part of ___captive_.
<ce>        Then do what you must to find their place of meeting.
<ce>            Your mission is to end this band's existence,
<ce>            and we will expect your return after you have
<ce>         slain the ringleader, no sooner. Fair travels, %pct.
<ce>                         You have one month.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 _qgiver_ tasked you with finding and
<ce>             slaying the criminals of ___captive_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            I knew we had put the matter into good hands.
<ce>              No doubt ___captive_ will spring back into
<ce>                form in little time. Fine work, %pcf.

Message:  1021
<ce>       You read the lengthy tract aloud. Before you finish, you
<ce>          notice a hooded figure standing nearby, apparently
<ce>              waiting for you to strike a conversation.

Message:  1022
<ce>                 Having gained the first strike, you
<ce>                    catch the scoundrel off guard.
<ce>
<ce>                "No, wait! My life isn't worth this!"
<ce>
<ce>          A terse interrogation follows, in which you learn
<ce>                 the band makes its home in ___dung_.
<ce>             Your hapless informant pleads to be spared.

Message:  1023
<ce>           This appears to have been the ringleader of the
<ce>             band. Counting all the others you have slain
<ce>                  here, it is easy to conclude that
<ce>                    ___captive_'s threat is over.

Message:  1026
<ce>               A hostile guard notices your arrival at
<ce>                         ___dung_ and begins
<ce>              to shout alarums to the rest of the band.

 _qgiver_ in ___qgiver_ has sent me
 to ___captive_ to root out a persistent and
 dangerous criminal band hiding in it.
 I have a piece of paper that should attract
 someone's attention, from whom I may
 be able to get more information. I have
 two months to slay the criminal group.
