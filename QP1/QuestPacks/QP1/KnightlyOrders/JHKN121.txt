QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>            Good day. We were recently informed of a witch
<ce>             hiding in another city, likely determined to
<ce>            do no good thing. We need someone to apprehend
<ce>                 her and bring an end to her crimes.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                Then what are you willing to do, %pct?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Her name is _witch_. Head on to
<ce>             ___res_ where she lives. You are assigned to
<ce>      capture her and bring her here for holding until a proper
<ce>        trial can be carried out. If she resists, that will be
<ce>      evidence sufficient of her witchery, and you are permitted
<ce>         to end the threat immediately. Whatever the outcome,
<ce>        you must return here within =timer_ days with news of
<ce>                 your success. Safest travels, %pct.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>        You are too late for the trial. Whatever cause you had
<ce>                     to hold _witch_ has expired.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                     Fine work, %pcf. Well done.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Witches are all around ____res_.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
D'you hear about that witch that escaped ____res_?

RumorsPostsuccess:  [1007]
Good thing there are knights out there to get rid of the witches.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of ___qgiver_ has
 assigned me to apprehend the witch of
 ___res_, _witch_. If she
 concedes I will return her to the knight
 hall to await her trial, and if she resists
 I am permitted to end her life. I have =timer_ days.

Message:  1011
<ce>            _witch_ looks at you with a perturbed glance.
<ce>
<ce>        "Me, a witch? This is nonsense! Is this about the %t?
<ce>          I knew this would come back to injure me! Please,
<ce>         won't you let me go? Must I stand trial for nothing
<ce>             at all? Honorable knight, this must not be!"
<ce>
<ce>          In spite of her complaints you bind her hands and
<ce>                      set forth for ___qgiver_.
                                     <--->
<ce>            _witch_ returns your glance with indignation.
<ce>
<ce>          "This is preposterous! I have lived here for =sum_
<ce>            years and only now am I accused of witchcraft?
<ce>         Speak to the tavern owners and the store merchants.
<ce>              They know the truth! How absurd this is!"
<ce>
<ce>          In spite of her complaints you bind her hands and
<ce>                      set forth for ___qgiver_.

Message:  1015
<ce>        Oh, a witch, am I? Fools will never recognize the good
<ce>             I do for ___res_ or for ____res_. Well then
<ce>       honorable knight, do your worst! I am prepared to fight!
                                     <--->
<ce>       Ha! You call me a witch and wish me to die? Fine thanks
<ce>              for defending ___res_ in its time of need.
<ce>            To Oblivion with thee! Thy time is come, %ra!

Message:  1016
<ce>            "Good %ra, my mind has turned the matter over
<ce>         while we have been journeying, and I feel it a shame
<ce>        that I should be held in contempt by bickering fools.
<ce>             I must protest my captivity, this instant!"
<ce>
<ce>               _witch_'s demeanor changes and she casts
<ce>                 an incantation of some sort, freeing
<ce>                    her hands from their binding.

Message:  1017
<ce>     You have eliminated the witch and any threat she presented.
<ce>                It is high time to report to _qgiver_.

Message:  1018
<ce>          Good day _witch_. I assume this %pct has explained
<ce>         the accusations against you? You will be held nearby
<ce>              under lock and key to prevent your flight.
<ce>          The trial will be in less than a day, so your fate
<ce>                      will not be long delayed.

Message:  1020
<ce>                So the rumors were true, correct %pcf?
<ce>      You have saved us much trouble, and for this we thank you.

Message:  1021
<ce>              This witch carried some scribbles speaking
<ce>              of a coven. You are not sure you can make
<ce>             sense of it, though you make great efforts.
<ce>                 In any case it is irrelevant to the
<ce>                       task _qgiver_ gave you.
