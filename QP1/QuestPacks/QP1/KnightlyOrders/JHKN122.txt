<ce>               Witches are beings of awesome power who
<ce>            should never be trifled with. We agree on that
<ce>                  matter, don't we %pcf? %crn needs
<ce>            our order's aid to free a miserable hole from
<ce>              a witch's curse, one that will trap within
<ce>             any who enter. Will you be the needed hero?
                                     <--->
<ce>           A forlorn labyrinth in the wilderness has become
<ce>             the home of a witch that will trap within
<ce>               those who enter its halls. We need a champion
<ce>             capable of slaying her to release the curse.
<ce>               Will you volunteer for this heroic act?

<ce>           What manner of knight do you intend to be, %pct?

<ce>                Go to ___dung_ as marked on your map.
<ce>           I will warn you that, once inside, you will not
<ce>           be permitted to leave. I expect a great deal of
<ce>             confused adventurers inside who cannot find
<ce>             their way out. Defend yourself as necessary,
<ce>             but remember that your only freedom will be
<ce>             in slaying the witch. Please get to the hole
<ce>              within =2dung_ days' time, lest the curse
<ce>                     capture more witless souls.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     _qgiver_ tasked you to go to
<ce>                 ___dung_ to find the witch by today.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            So our witch was in fact a daedra in disguise?
<ce>          Perhaps it was an illusion spell instead. I do not
<ce>         know which of the two would have more magical power,
<ce>             for both are foes to be dreaded. My fullest
<ce>                 congratulations to you, %pct. I will
<ce>                 inform the %t concerning your deed.

<ce>                        (DAEDRIC CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>         This witch shouts several discordant phrases at you
<ce>          with a hostile tone. Whatever language she speaks,
<ce>                it is clear you do not understand it.

Message:  1011
<ce>                        (DAEDRIC CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>         This witch shouts several discordant phrases at you,
<ce>        which you immediately identify as Daedric. You respond
<ce>      with sufficient speed and wit as to catch her by surprise,
<ce>                     allowing you the first blow.

Message:  1012
<ce>            The power trapping these halls seems to lift.
<ce>                  The witch has likely fled by now.
<ce>                        Your task has failed.

Message:  1013
<ce>     The air is very heavy here, laden with magical enchantments.
<ce>        If _qgiver_ spoke truly, you will not be able to leave
<ce>            until the witch is slain or has fled the cave.

Message:  1014
<ce>                A loud and angry voice erupts nearby.
<ce>
<ce>            "If I can't get out of here I'll kill you all!
<ce>                  Every one of you! Come over here!"
                                     <--->
<ce>                A loud and scared voice erupts nearby.
<ce>
<ce>               "There's no hope for us! We're all dead!
<ce>                      We're never getting out!"

Message:  1015
<ce>            Powerful magicks whisk you back into ___dung_.
<ce>                   This is no ordinary foe at work.

Message:  1016
<ce>           You have slain the witch. Immediately the arcane
<ce>             powers at work in ___dung_ begin to unravel.
<ce>              You will presumably be able to leave now.

%qdt:
 _qgiver_ has given me
 =2dung_ days to enter a hole called
 ___dung_ to find a
 witch maintaining a curse on it.
 How long I take within is my own judgment,
 and I should report to ___qgiver_
 when I have slain the enchantress.
