QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>         The formidable outlaw known as the Crow has surfaced
<ce>           in %crn. We need someone well-armed to apprehend
<ce>           him and bring him to trial here. Will you do so?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          Well, I suppose I can enlist someone more valiant.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   His hideout is _res_ of ___res_.
<ce>       The man is wanted in several provinces for indescribable
<ce>       crimes against civilization. Use any means available to
<ce>        subdue him. I wish you could avoid the lethal method,
<ce>        but ultimate resistance calls for the ultimate prybar.
<ce>          However you do it, return here within =timer_ days
<ce>                 for his trial. %god watch over you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>      _qgiver_ needed your report on the Crow before the trial.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>          A body double? What a shame. This tends to be his
<ce>          manner of evasion, but we hoped this would be the
<ce>           time we succeeded. Your work will be counted as
<ce>          a victory, my good %pct, though he has escaped us.
<ce>                 Thank you for doing a knight's work.

<ce>         The Crow grins at you inhumanly, his face stretching
<ce>       beyond ordinary proportions. His head begins to pull out
<ce>           toward both sides, and his eyes turn bright red.
<ce>           Once his skin turns a different color it is well
<ce>        apparent that this is not the Crow, but a well-placed
<ce>       diversion. Your task will no doubt require slaying this
<ce>             foe before reporting the matter to _qgiver_.

Message:  1011
<ce>       The Crow has escaped but this grants him one fewer place
<ce>              to hide. _qgiver_ will want to know this.
