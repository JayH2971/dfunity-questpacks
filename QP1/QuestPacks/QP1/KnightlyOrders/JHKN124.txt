QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>         A knave in the region has been usurping the minds of
<ce>          some of %crn's womenfolk, washing their brains and
<ce>         forcing them to do his bidding. Will you stop this?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   Why? Is this not urgent enough?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>          We do not know where the man hides, but we presume
<ce>         his ensorcelled maidens do. One such affected damsel
<ce>                   is _maid_ of ___maidh_. You will
<ce>      want the Mages Guild's aid in this matter. Go to ___mager_
<ce>             and look for a magician named _mage_ in the
<ce>       guild hall. We are informed that %g1 will have a trinket
<ce>        with power to temporarily suspend the charm spell, and
<ce>         hopefully you will be able to extract his resorting
<ce>         place during that lapse. Have done with this matter
<ce>                within =timer_ days, for %crn's honor.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>     Your quest to stop the enchanter of ____mager_ has expired.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>        Fine work, %pcf. I have already received word that the
<ce>           man's subjects have been freed from their curse.
<ce>          I do not doubt they will hold your name in honor.

Message:  1010
<ce>    Good day, %pct. Such troubling times we live in, are they not?
<ce>    Take this _tri_. It will have power to suspend the enchantment
<ce>     on these women for a few moments. Ask your questions quickly
<ce>       at the time you use it. With any luck they will despise
<ce>      being controlled and give you the information you desire.
<ce>          Well met, %ra, and I wish you luck on your quest.
                                     <--->

<ce>               _maid_ shrieks and trembles at thin air.
<ce>         She stares at you with maddened eyes, wanting to say
<ce>      something but restrained by magical forces from doing so.
                                     <--->
<ce>          _maid_ struggles to speak but is kept in silence.
<ce>     She looks around, clearly afraid of something you can't see.

Message:  1012
<ce>          A wave of magical power disperses from the _tri_,
<ce>    providing a momentary schism in the enchantment. You scarcely
<ce>    need to ask the question, as the maiden is quite forthcoming.
<ce>
<ce>                    "_capt_! Kill h-him! Pleeease!
<ce>                   In, in ___farm_! Help me! I..."
<ce>
<ce>     Within moments her eyes glaze over and the ability to speak
<ce>    departs. You now have the name and location of the enchanter.

Message:  1013
<ce>                  You immediately spot _capt_, whose
<ce>             appearance gives him away. He casts a brief
<ce>              incantation to teleport for the advantage.

Message:  1014
<ce>        You have defeated a powerful magician. Hopefully that
<ce>          will be enough to end the curse. You should report
<ce>                back to _qgiver_ on your proceedings.

Message:  1020
<ce>                      (THAUMATURGY CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>    Your knowledge of Thaumaturgy is enough to give you the edge.
<ce> You cast a quick cantrip which causes the vampire temporary immobility.

Message:  1021
<ce>                        (STEALTH CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>       Vampires are experts at stealth, but you can do better.
<ce>             You manage to evade this vampire's tracking.

%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of ___qgiver_
 has given me orders to find an
 enchanter in ____qgiver_ who has
 ensorcelled several women to do his
 bidding. I am to get a trinket from
 _mage_ of the Mages Guild in
 ___mager_ and take it to a woman
 named _maid_ in ___maidh_.
 I have =timer_ days to defeat
 the man behind the scheme.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 _maid_ was able to speak
 long enough to tell me that the enchanter's
 name is _capt_, and that he hides
 away in ___farm_.
