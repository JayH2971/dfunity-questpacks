<ce>               Merchants around %crn have been waylaid
<ce>           by a band of thieves in their travels. They have
<ce>          petitioned our order for help in rooting them out.
<ce>             Are you willing to go along with their plot?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 These people need a guardian, %pct.

<ce>            "Excellent. Now, it is difficult to tell where
<ce>           the band will strike next. Your task will be to
<ce>                 remain with _guide_ and %g3 caravan
<ce>           until the thieves come out of hiding. Travel to
<ce>           various small settlements, for the reports tell
<ce>             us they tend to shy away from large cities.
<ce>            Level them to the earth and report to me your
<ce>             success. I grant you one month to do this."
<ce>
<ce>                    _qgiver_ calls out to _guide_
<ce>               and introduces you, explaining the task.
<ce>                  The merchant thanks you profusely.
<ce>
<ce>           "This is wonderful! I have the fullest assurance
<ce>         that this problem will be dealt with in record time.
<ce>           I suppose that we should just go traveling about
<ce>                         until they find us!"

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             During this fracas _guide_ has fallen dead.
<ce>            This is a terrible price to pay for uncovering
<ce>                        this group of thieves.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>          _qgiver_ shakes your hand warmly for your service.

Message:  1020
<ce>                 Your small caravan is surrounded by
<ce>              a pack of thieves. Presumably this is what
<ce>                      _qgiver_ sent you to find.

Message:  1021
<ce>                _guide_, unscathed during the battle,
<ce>         is overjoyed to know that the group has been slain.

Message:  1022
<ce>                  Welcome, %pct. So _guide_ did not
<ce>           survive the battle, it would seem. We are elated
<ce>              at the destruction of this thieving band,
<ce>          but we wish it did not have to come at this cost.
<ce>              I nevertheless thank you for your service.
<ce>            %crn will be greatly benefitted by your work.

Message:  1023
<ce>          Welcome, %pct. You have slain the band of thieves
<ce>            and preserved the life of the merchant. Truly
<ce>         you have passed this test with flying colors. I will
<ce>           tell new recruits to this order concerning your
<ce>         deeds and the example they provide. Excellent work.

Message:  1024
<ce>                Though _guide_ fell during the battle,
<ce>              this band is still vanquished. It is time
<ce>                        to report to _qgiver_.

Message:  1030
