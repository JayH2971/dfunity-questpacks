<ce>                A band of rabblerousers is attempting
<ce>             to inflict its own form of perverted justice
<ce>               on one of %crn's cities. We need someone
<ce>              to go restore order to a city in turmoil.
<ce>                          Will that be you?
                                     <--->
<ce>               Some scheming citizens in one of %crn's
<ce>           cities have taken the law into their own hands,
<ce>              punishing and pursuing whoever they will.
<ce>             Someone must eliminate this band. Will you?

<ce>                 Sigh. You are rank %pct, aren't you?

<ce>                Very well. Head on to ___captive_. The
<ce>          band is quite skilled at remaining undercover and
<ce>             will likely pull no punches against someone
<ce>            trying to unravel their scheme. They consider
<ce>          themselves the true town guard, and apparently the
<ce>             guardsmen of ___captive_ are quite complicit
<ce>          in the plot. I predict a good number of beheadings
<ce>        once order returns to the place. You will likely have
<ce>          no more than a day once your investigation begins,
<ce>          for they will scatter off to another city to take
<ce>           it over once they see their conspiracy in peril.
<ce>             Prepare here, and then go when you are ready
<ce>                      to represent our good %t.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             Arriving in ___captive_, you are apparently
<ce>             already in violation of some homebrewn law.
<ce>          An enforcer sets out to stop you, weapon in hand.

 ___captive_ has been overtaken
 by a group of self-proclaimed enforcers
 of the law. I am to vanquish the band
 of vigilantes, taking no more than one
 day once I am inside.
