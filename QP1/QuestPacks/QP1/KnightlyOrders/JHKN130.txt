<ce>                     A family native to this city
<ce>                    has informed us of a relative
<ce>                     who was kidnapped by knaves
<ce>                  and taken for ransom. They cannot
<ce>                   pay, but someone must. Will you
<ce>                  go and offer up the price to save
<ce>                         the captive's life?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Someone here has to have deep pockets, surely.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    You are to look for _ransom_,
<ce>           who was abducted a few days previous. The family
<ce>               was informed that the handler will be in
<ce>                       a store called _place_,
<ce>                  in the city of ___place_. I do not
<ce>                  need to emphasize, my friend, that
<ce>              this entirely depends on you. If you fail,
<ce>               no one else will be able to clean up the
<ce>                  mess. They will expect you within
<ce>                       =2place_ days. Godspeed.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             The ransom date has passed. You have failed.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    _ransom_, we will notify your
<ce>              family immediately. What a joy we all feel
<ce>             for your safe return. And what a noble act,
<ce>            %pcf! I will voice it abroad as far as I can.
<ce>             This is the work of true knights. A hundred
<ce>                   congratulations on your success.
                                     <--->
<ce>              %oth, I have spent sleepless nights since
<ce>            I sent you out, %pct. My fears were unfounded.
<ce>             Please, _ransom_ wait here. I will send out
<ce>            a squire to find your family. And as for you,
<ce>                %pcf, I will voice your act all abroad
<ce>                %crn. Let no one forget your selfless
<ce>               sacrifice for one who cannot repay you.

 I have accepted a task
 from ==qgiver_ to retrieve a
 person at ransom. As the family
 is too poor to pay, I will offer up
 the sum myself. The contact is to be
 found in ___place_, at a
 shop called _place_.
 I must do so within =2place_ days.

<ce>          Should be a nice Sundas stroll for ya. Later kid.

<ce>             "By %god, I had given up all hope. I thought
<ce>           the ransom failed and they left me to die here.
<ce>                     Please, take me from here!"

No more funny business. Take the gold
