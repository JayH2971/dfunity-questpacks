QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  A pest infestation has taken hold of
<ce>  a palace in %crn, and the %t
<ce>  has delegated to us the task of finding
<ce>  someone clever enough to end it.
<ce>  This will not require combat, %pct.
<ce>  We wish to send you on a manhunt
<ce>  of the civilized kind.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  Surely we can find a task more adventuresome
<ce>  for one of your skill set.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  This will be a simple task, good knight,
<ce>  at least in theory. You must merely find
<ce>  an expert in bat extermination. Do not
<ce>  bother trying to slay them yourself.
<ce>  The %t has sent enough warriors to
<ce>  prove that the problem is serious.
<ce>  Ask around among the people to find
<ce>  someone qualified enough, and inform
<ce>  him or her that there will be payment.
<ce>  Surely you can have this problem
<ce>  solved, and your report in this hall,
<ce>  within =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  If you are here, why do I continue to
<ce>  hear about rodents infesting the
<ce>  palace of ___palace_?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  How was the expedition, %pct?
<ce>  Feel pride in having served your
<ce>  fellow citizens. That is the great
<ce>  ideal of the __questgiver_.

Message:  1010
A real shame, isn't it? The %t takes our money but can't keep a palace clean.
<--->
They say no one's better for bats than _ext_.
<--->
If ya gotta kill bats, ya head on over to ___exthouse_, knight. Ask for _ext_ there.
<--->
Bat problem? You want _ext_. Stays in _exthouse_ in ___exthouse_.

Message:  1011
<ce> What? Oh, bother. You're lucky the %t
<ce> pays well. I'd rather cover your face
<ce> in hemlock if this weren't worth my time.
<ce> Very well, lead the way.

Message:  1012
<ce> _ext_'s reputation is well earned.
<ce> Recognizing the problem in short order,
<ce> %g1 sets about cutting small holes around the
<ce> palace and placing poisonous herbs within
<ce> them. As %g1 makes a full sweep of the
<ce> building, you notice one fledgling rodent chew
<ce> on the toxic plants and almost immediately
<ce> cease breathing. A potent mix, to be sure.
<ce> 
<ce> When the project is finished, a dapper servant
<ce> approaches and praises _ext_'s work.
<ce> 
<ce> "Oh, what a blessing to have found you!
<ce> It's been utterly insufferable in here
<ce> with these beasts terrorizing us.
<ce> We have set apart these =dummy_ gold pieces
<ce> for you, which we hope will be compensation
<ce> sufficient to the task."
<ce> 
<ce> _ext_ curtly accepts the reward
<ce> and departs without so much as a goodbye.
<ce> _questgiver_ will want your report.

Message:  1013
<ce> Your nose and ears have no difficulty
<ce> picking up on the presence of bats
<ce> in this palace.

Message:  1014
<ce> They do appear to be endless.
<ce> Nearby attendants thank you for
<ce> relieving their suffering, even if
<ce> it is temporary.

%qdt:
 _questgiver_ has asked me to
 find a bat exterminator skilled
 enough to clean the palace of
 ___palace_. Perhaps the
 townspeople would know of
 someone suitable to the task.
 I should return to __questgiver_
 in ___questgiver_ before
 =timer_ days have passed.

Message:  1031
