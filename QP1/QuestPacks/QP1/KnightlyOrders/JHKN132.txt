<ce>              We require a knight of true virtue to slay
<ce>          a Daedra Seducer, a being of considerable magical
<ce>               power. Do you consider yourself capable?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                We shall find some brave warrior then.

<ce>                 You will find your foe in ___dung_.
<ce>          The complaint came to us from a woman of a nearby
<ce>                settlement whose husband, _husb_, was
<ce>            beguiled by the monster. You would do well to
<ce>              avoid slaying him, but if you must, do so.
<ce>            Report your success here within =timer_ days,
<ce>                     for the honor of __qgiver_.

<ce>                   You are truly brave to best such
<ce>          dangerous daedra. Your presence honors this hall.

<ce>                      _husb_ cries out in fury.
<ce>
<ce>                  "No! My wife, my beautiful wife!"

Message:  1011
<ce>                     _husb_ glares at you, ready
<ce>                to give his life to defend his captor.

Message:  1012
<ce>                    Though _husb_ had to be slain,
<ce>                you are victorious. %crn need not fear
<ce>                       this monster any longer.

Message:  1013
<ce>                    _husb_ stops in his tracks and
<ce>                      looks around, dumbfounded.
<ce>
<ce>             "By %god, what have I done here? I was under
<ce>            that monster's spell for weeks! My poor wife,
<ce>             my family! I thank you, hero, but I must see
<ce>                            them at once!"
<ce>
<ce>                        He races for the exit.

Message:  1014
<ce>             Your valor in sparing the foolish man's life
<ce>          has not gone unnoticed. You will be quite the hero
<ce>                    in %crn if _husb_ has his way.
