<ce>           Few troubles concern a knightly order more than
<ce>                a noble gone berserk. We mostly avoid
<ce>      such a problem, but today we come close. One of our knight
<ce>        brothers is betrothed to the daughter of an important
<ce>    aristocrat, and only recently gained information that her past
<ce>     is not as pure as promised. He wishes out of the engagement,
<ce>      but fears royal wrath. We require a knight more persuasive
<ce>   than any other. Have you etiquette to ward off a furious parent?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          Perhaps we'll have to employ a bard of some sort.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            You will not journey far this time. Meet _nob_
<ce>         in the palace of this city and make a good argument
<ce>            for our brother, _knight_, whatever you will.
<ce>       Defend his honor and save him from his pending marriage.
<ce>         If words fail, I trust you will find some other way.
<ce>            Five days will not pass before our man must be
<ce>             granted liberty, %pct. %god guide your way.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    _knight_ will be irretrievably
<ce>                    engaged to the damsel by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                 Very well, I see that this must be.
<ce>        I wish to never see that cretin again, but I will not
<ce>             hold __qgiver_ responsible. Be off with you,
<ce>           squire, and be more careful than this lout was.
<ce>                 Life only gives you so many chances.

RumorsPostSuccess:  [1007]
Them Archaeologists are good people, I says.
<--->
The Archaeologists and the Mages Guild are always fighting about stuff. %god knows what.

QuestorPostFailure:  [1009]
Someone else stepped up after your failure with _nob_, thank %god.

%qdt:
 __qgiver_ in ___qgiver_
 need me to speak to a noble named
 _nob_ in the local palace,
 to end the betrothal of
 %g3 daughter and _knight_.
 I have =timer_ days.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
 _nob_ has rejected my request to
 liberate _knight_ and demands a sum of
 2,500 gold coins instead.

<ce>
<ce>              Hmph. As hard as your story is to believe,
<ce>               I must give __qgiver_ their proper due.
<ce>              This scandal will cost us all more than we
<ce>          bargained for... But the alternative is far worse.

<ce>                       (ETIQUETTE CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>             Perhaps you overestimated your speechcraft.
<ce>                       _nob_ flies into a rage.
<ce>             Insults flow regarding you, your parentage,
<ce>                       _knight_, and __qgiver_.
<ce>
<ce>          "Perhaps I was a fool to let things get this far,
<ce>          if _knight_ is so low as to make such allegations.
<ce>           My daughter will not marry a reprobate! I demand
<ce>         2,500 gold pieces to repay what I've sunk into this
<ce>            miserable betrothal. I will then send notices
<ce>               of remittal to the interested parties."
<ce>
<ce>             _nob_ continues to glare at you, waiting for
<ce>                 the money. __qgiver_ probably won't
<ce>                        be able to help you...

Message:  1017
<ce>            You shuffle around to find 2,500 gold pieces,
<ce>              but do not have enough. _nob_ seethes with
<ce>       rage, though %g1 does not open %g3 mouth to release it.

Message:  1018
<ce>             You discreetly deliver the 2,500 gold pieces
<ce>                          into _nob_'s hand.
