QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>          We have received a directive from the very %rt
<ce>          to wipe out the Dark Brotherhood from
<ce>          our fair %crn. We are sending out many
<ce>          knights on this task, and if you wish to
<ce>          take part, you will be considered
<ce>          a hero of this land.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          There's... no particular reason for
<ce>          your refusal, is there %pct?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>        A fine answer. When you return within =timer_ days'
<ce>          time, a letter signed by my hand will be sent
<ce>          to the %rt's court and will be read aloud.
<ce>          We are aware of the danger this task presents,
<ce>          and wish only for our greatest knights to embark upon it.
<ce>          
<ce>          You are assigned to the village of ___dung_.
<ce>          A few trustworthy citizens of the area, allying with
<ce>          our cause, will have information regarding the
<ce>          Brotherhood's hideout in the town.
<ce>          Ask the townspeople concerning "_gem_".
<ce>          Those who know this code word will lead you aright.
<ce>          Destroy our foes and return here for well-deserved fame.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             The deadline to return to __qgiver_ has passed.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              Finest work, %pct. You'll soon find that the people of
<ce>              %crn will pay great deference to you. Or at least,
<ce>              any with a mind to appreciate the protection of their
<ce>              lives. Our salute to you.

QuestorPostSuccess:   [1008]
One who faces the Dark Brotherhood without fear merits great respect.

QuestorPostFailure:   [1009]
The Dark Brotherhood will continue their evil reign due to efforts like yours.

Message:  1010
_gem_? Shh... yes, they're in a shop. Look for _dung_.
<--->
_gem_, yes, please help us. They're in _dung_.
<--->
You want some _gem_? They don't sell none of that around here.
<--->
No _gem_ around here mate. You'd find that in an abandoned castle or somesuch.

Message:  1011
<ce>   However the Dark Brotherhood knew of your arrival,
<ce>   they didn't take any chances. A metal hook flies out
<ce>   from the wall, and though your neck evades it,
<ce>   your arm doesn't. You find yourself wedged to the
<ce>   door with a makeshift handcuff.
<ce>   
<ce>   "Who is it?! Say your name!"
<ce>   
<ce>   The denizens of this hideout approach.
<ce>   You're running out of time. Do you attempt
<ce>   to yank the the restraint out of the wall
<ce>   before they arrive? A failed attempt
<ce>   could be quite painful.
<ce>   
<ce>   (ATTRIBUTE CHECK: STRENGTH, DIFFICULTY: VERY HIGH)

Message:  1012
<ce>  (ATTRIBUTE CHECK PASSED!)
<ce>  
<ce>  It takes a burst of effort, but arms like yours
<ce>  cannot be restrained. You yank your wrist free,
<ce>  taking the metal restraint and a chunk of the wall
<ce>  with it. Once you shake it off, you are free
<ce>  to engage the rapidly approaching Brotherhood.
<ce>  
<ce>  If you leave without killing them, they will escape
<ce>  and your mission will be in vain.

Message:  1013
<ce>  (ATTRIBUTE CHECK FAILED)
<ce>  
<ce>  You brace yourself, flex hard, and slam your arm forward
<ce>  in an attempt to pull the restraint out of the wall,
<ce>  then hold back an agonized cry as the metal refuses
<ce>  to give way, causing a deep injury to your forearm.
<ce>  After a few more attempts, you yank the cuff
<ce>  out of the wall and free yourself, barely dodging some
<ce>  darts that shoot out of the wall.
<ce>  
<ce>  If you leave without killing the Dark Brotherhood,
<ce>  they will escape and your mission will be in vain.

Message:  1014
<ce>  You decide not to risk injury to your arm,
<ce>  and instead work to hastily undo the restraint.
<ce>  Footsteps approach as you pull and pry. Though you
<ce>  manage to free yourself and toss the metal cuff
<ce>  to the ground, you happen to get shot by a dart
<ce>  trap on the opposite wall during your labor.
<ce>  
<ce>  If you leave without killing the Dark Brotherhood,
<ce>  they will escape and your mission will be in vain.

Message:  1015
<ce>  The shop goes silent. None remain within.

Message:  1016
<ce>  Once you exit, two armed figures take place a short
<ce>  distance from you. These must be the last of
<ce>  the Dark Brotherhood in ___dung_.

Message:  1017
<ce>  Your mission is complete. The %rt has sent a
<ce>  strong message to the Dark Brotherhood
<ce>  by your hand.

Message:  1018
<ce>  You exit the Brotherhood hideout,
<ce>  sparing foes within. They flee
<ce>  the shop by any means necessary.
<ce>  Now that they have escaped,
<ce>  your task is frustrated.
