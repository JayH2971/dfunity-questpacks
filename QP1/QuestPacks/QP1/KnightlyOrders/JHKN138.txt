<ce>               A fellow arrived this morning requesting
<ce>          sanctuary and an escort across town, providing no
<ce>            further information. We have reason to assume
<ce>          the man is threatened by something that he refuses
<ce>         to disclose. We have staked our honor on protecting
<ce>            those in need, even when information is scant.
<ce>             Will you help this man across ___goalplace_?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                The case appears suspicious, I agree.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    _qgiver_ claps his hands, and
<ce>                a man appears from an adjoining room.
<ce>
<ce>                 "%pcn, I now introduce you to _npc_,
<ce>                 your ward. You are to deliver him to
<ce>                 _goalplace_ within two hours' time.
<ce>                       Godspeed and farewell."

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>            Six hours have passed, and _npc_ grows restless.
<ce>                     He wanders off without you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              It would be easy to question your judgment
<ce>                 when all the facts aren't available.
<ce>               You merely hope you did the right thing.

QuestorPostSuccess:  [1008]
So _npc_ was not what we were told? A mighty knight must also carry a mighty conscience, %pct.

Message:  1010
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of __qgiver_,
 ___qgiver_, has requested
 my aid in protecting a man named
 _npc_ en route to _goalplace_
 within the same town.
 The man must arrive within two hours.

Message:  1011
<ce>                      You hear a tumult nearby.
<ce>               The city watch are looking for someone.
<ce>                _npc_ suddenly grows very nervous and
<ce>              hides behind you. He speaks in a whisper.
<ce>
<ce>       "There they are! They're coming for me! They'll kill me!
<ce>          Please, I'm innocent! Don't believe what they say!
<ce>        Tell them my name is %mn or something else, anything!"
<ce>
<ce>           Before you can escape, a pair of guards see you
<ce>                    and _npc_. They run toward you
<ce>                      and demand that you stop.
<ce>
<ce>        "Halt! This =npc_ matches the description of a burglar
<ce>           who has plagued ___goalplace_ for the last week.
<ce>          Turn him over, and we will bring him to justice."
<ce>
<ce>              You have no further information to go on,
<ce>                      and must make a decision.
<ce>            You could lie and say they have the wrong man,
<ce>                   or turn him over to the guards.
<ce>                          What will you do?

Message:  1012
<ce>           Your job is to protect the innocent, and though
<ce>             you can't know for certain, this man may be.
<ce>         You lie and say that this man is a reputed member of
<ce>            __qgiver_, and could not be guilty. The guards
<ce>      confer among themselves for a moment, and then look back.
<ce>
<ce>         "If you're wrong, __qgiver_ will pay it to Oblivion!
<ce>                 The city watch will not be mocked!"
<ce>
<ce>                 They hurry off to find the culprit.

Message:  1013
<ce>            You grab _npc_ and push him toward the guards.
<ce>                They tie his hands and force him into
<ce>             a frogmarch as they alert the other guards.
<ce>
<ce>                  "__qgiver_ have found our culprit!
<ce>                           Huzzah! Huzzah!"
<ce>
<ce>           You just hope he's actually guilty of the crime.

Message:  1014
<ce>                  Within the safety of _goalplace_,
<ce>                _npc_ gets on both knees to thank you.
<ce>
<ce>           "Oh my knight, thank you, thank you, thank you!!
<ce>           You don't know what they would have done if they
<ce>            arrested me! I'll not forget your kindness and
<ce>                        mercy, that I won't!"
<ce>
<ce>     He leaves you to find a place to hide inside the residence.
