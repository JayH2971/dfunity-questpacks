QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  A lodge in %crn is suffering from
<ce>  the instigation of a necromancer,
<ce>  a conjurer of the undead.
<ce>  We need someone who does not fear
<ce>  the disembodied or the night time.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>   This kind of invasion is quite common.
<ce>   You'll see this kind of request a lot.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  We know not where the villain hides,
<ce>  for we have searched every home
<ce>  in __tavernhome_. What remains now
<ce>  is to stay on the streets at night,
<ce>  when the hauntings occur,
<ce>  and destroy every spirit that appears.
<ce>  Sooner or later the necromancer will
<ce>  appear, and then you must strike.
<ce>  Have this done within =timer_ days,
<ce>  for honor's sake.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  __qgiver_ assigned you to slay
<ce>  the Necromancer of __tavernhome_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  With the mage defeated, the remaining spirits fade away.
<ce>  The townspeople part their doors to look outside.
<ce>  The danger is gone, and they cheer exultantly for you.
<ce>  Though no monetary reward is forthcoming,
<ce>  your name will not be quickly forgotten here.

Message:  1010
<ce>  This is the right place, but there's too much sunlight.
<ce>  You'll need to be outside when it's later at night.

Message:  1011
<ce>  You see no necromancer as yet, but spirits have
<ce>  begun to haunt the streets of __tavernhome_.

Message:  1012
<ce>  "You! You are the knave who stops my work!"
<ce>  
<ce>  It appears you've earned the necromancer's attention.
