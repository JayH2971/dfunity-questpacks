<ce>      We have been advised of some fool
<ce>  who has holed up to practice summoning daedra.
<ce>  Regardless of the mage's capability, we must
<ce>  treat this as a real threat. We need a knight
<ce>  to take the battle to the summoner and prevent a crisis,
<ce>  before any demons are summoned.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>    Let us know if you see any heroes out there.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>   I will mark ___dung_ on your map. Somewhere inside,
<ce>  the rogue mage works. You'll likely encounter
<ce>  imps while inside, as they were summoned
<ce>  as part of an earlier experiment.
<ce>  Bring me word of the demonologist's death
<ce>  within =timer_ days, that we may be at peace.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    _qgiver_ expected your report
<ce>                  regarding the daedra summoner by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>      Fine work, %pct. It's much better for us to
<ce>  pre-empt these cases -- no one enjoys
<ce>  fighting the daedra.

QuestorPostSuccess:   [1008]
Keep practicing your skills, and even the toughest daedra will fall to you.

Message:  1010
<ce>  Faint magical energy tinges the air.
<ce>  You hope you're not too late to stop
<ce>  this daedra summoner.

Message:  1011
<ce>  "No! You'll not stop me, not when I'm so close!"

Message:  1012
<ce>  The summoner is defeated, the ritual interrupted.
