QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  My name is _qgiver_. The Order has
<ce>               recently been made aware of a terror of
<ce>               the night, a vampire of no small renown,
<ce>                  lurking in a pitiful hole in %crn.
<ce>               We are the protectorate of this land and
<ce>             cannot tolerate such a threat to its people.
<ce>              Will you answer the call and descend into
<ce>                        the depths of ___dung_
<ce>                     to slay this undead monster?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             We could certainly let it consume a few more
<ce>                innocents and grow more powerful, yes.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      Then be going to ___dung_
<ce>                 to rid us of this evil. You will be
<ce>                        accompanied by _mage_
<ce>                    of the Mages Guild, whose main
<ce>                  purpose will be ensuring the body
<ce>                  is incapable of rising once more.
<ce>                Nevertheless, %g1 could have something
<ce>                    meaningful to offer in combat.
<ce>              The two of you will return here in =timer_
<ce>            days with a report of your success. Farewell.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>           Your deadline to slay the vampire and report to
<ce>                         _qgiver_ has passed.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   You are a credit to %crn, %pcf.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
The %t's been meeting with the Dark Brotherhood, they says.

Message:  1010
<ce>               _mage_ recognizes this vampire at once.
<ce>
<ce>                 "Ho! =vam1_, your end has at hand!"
<ce>
<ce>                 A binding spell follows, which slows
<ce>                the abomination momentarily. This must
<ce>               be preparation for the corpse disposal.

Message:  1020
<ce>                    You have defeated the vampire.
<ce>                 _mage_ spends some time with fairly
<ce>            elaborate pyrotechnics and sharp instruments,
<ce>               the likes of which do not logically lead
<ce>             to a permanent end to vampirism but against
<ce>              which you hold no qualm. Soon you are both
<ce>                           ready to leave.
                                     <--->
<ce>                    You have defeated the vampire.
<ce>                  _mage_ casts several arcane spells
<ce>                around the corpse which appear to hold
<ce>                it in place. Whether it will serve the
<ce>               purpose or not is beyond your knowledge
<ce>                and responsibility. Soon you are both
<ce>                           ready to leave.

Message:  1021
<ce>           This vampire has knowledge of powerful magicks.
<ce>              A shocking bolt lances out in your general
<ce>                     direction, and _mage_ falls.

Message:  1022
<ce>               You have defeated the vampire. You offer
<ce>                    _mage_ as proper a burial you
<ce>               can under the circumstances. Surely %g3
<ce>                      sacrifice will be honored.

Message:  1023
<ce>                 Hail our slayers of vampires! Such a
<ce>                   crusade should always merit the
<ce>                    attention of knights. We will
<ce>                    speak of your deeds to inspire
<ce>                    the younger generation to rise
<ce>                    above their own selves. Surely
<ce>                   you will tell the Mages Guild of
<ce>                  %pcf's great service and utility,
<ce>                      _mage_? I am certain %pg1
<ce>                preserved your life quite skillfully.

Message:  1024
<ce>                    Hail %pcn, slayer of vampires!
<ce>                       What is that? _mage_ was
<ce>               slain in the battle? This is truly grave
<ce>               news, though we are pleased that we must
<ce>              no longer fear the vampire's encroaches on
<ce>                our land. I thank you for braving the
<ce>                  depths on such a perilous mission.
