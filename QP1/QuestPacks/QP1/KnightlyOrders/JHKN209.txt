QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              %pct, I have a few questions. Do you hate
<ce>           giants, the bumbling, violent kidnappers of farm
<ce>             animals and unaware townspeople? And do you
<ce>               hate the Necromancers, who raise up our
<ce>           ancestors in dark slavery? And would you hate a
<ce>              group of giant Necromancers, who can both
<ce>             squash their enemies and raise their spirits
<ce>                          to fight for them?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          The answers to these questions should be obvious.
<ce>                 On what matter do you differ, %pcf?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Then go to ___dung_. The existence
<ce>          of such barbarians with some skill in the magical
<ce>           arts is a great anomaly, one we have no need to
<ce>            tolerate. The Mages Guild has the duty to wipe
<ce>               %crn clean of necromancy, and they find
<ce>           themselves in a state of temporary dereliction.
<ce>             They informed us that destroying the menaces
<ce>           to the townsfolk are our responsibility. If you
<ce>            will wipe out this band of mage giants, I will
<ce>           inform our lordship of the Mages Guild's failure
<ce>          to respond. Let us meet here again within =timer_
<ce>                days with each of our tasks completed.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  _qgiver_ needed you to destroy the
<ce>                      giant necromancers by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>         Stellar work. I have done my part on the diplomatic
<ce>        side of things. If the Mages Guild wishes to keep its
<ce>            charter in %crn, they will need to pick up the
<ce>            pace. Thank you for keeping our citizens safe.

Message:  1020
<ce>      This giant immediately recognizes you as a serious threat.
<ce>     It begins chanting, and you feel a dark presence draw near.

Message:  1021
<ce>      Once this giant falls, you feel the dark presence subside.
<ce>            The cult of necromantic giants has been slain.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ has tasked
 me with slaying a cult of giants in
 __dung_ who have
 somehow gained knowledge of
 necromancy. I have =timer_ days to
 return to ___qgiver_.

Message:  1099
<ce>               Slaying giants and ending necromancy are
<ce>                both worthy acts. How much more worthy
<ce>                is doing them at the same time, then?
