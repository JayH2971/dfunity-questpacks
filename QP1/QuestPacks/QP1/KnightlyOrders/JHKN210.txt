QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  %pct, we must all engage in the humblest of work. Slaying dragons
<ce>    and defending nobles are some of our duties, but they are only
<ce>       some forms of the service we provide. Take this _weapon_
<ce>        to _knight_, who either forgot or refused to take it.
<ce>          Look for %g2 in ___knighttown_. Will you do this?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            Is this truly the path you wish to take, %ra?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>           Good. I will give you =timer_ days to have done
<ce>          with it and return. And if %g1 is merely stubborn,
<ce>          do not accept another refusal. I have told %g2 too
<ce>           many times that our knights must be practiced in
<ce>                       all manner of weaponry.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>     You needed to report your success in delivering the _weapon_
<ce>            to _knight_ by now. This is not a good start.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                      Thank you for going, %pcf.

<ce>             What is this? Some _weapon_? _qgiver_ never
<ce>      told me I would be taking one on this expedition. Keep it
<ce>     for yourself. Oh, come now, just take it. I do not want it.
<ce>         I said, I do not want it! %oth, then give it to me.
<ce>     I'll throw it at the first orc I encounter and be done with
<ce>             it. Are you happy now, %ra? Begone from me.
                                     <--->
<ce>              %oth, did _qgiver_ send you? Praise %god.
<ce>          I knew %g1 would bury me if I forgot that _weapon_
<ce>     this time. Here, let me have it. I'm no expert yet, but I'll
<ce>         give it some practice while I'm in the depths. I'll
<ce>           be a Keeper before %g1 knows it! Farewell, %ra.
                                     <--->
<ce>            Hold, %ra! Silence! What is that? My _weapon_?
<ce>      %oth, I hadn't realized I had left it. How good it is that
<ce>     I had other matters to resolve here in ___knighttown_ before
<ce> entering that cave. A terrifying prospect it is to face an atronach
<ce>    and realize I'm missing a weapon. How good of you to bring it
<ce>           to me! Give _qgiver_ my regards. Fare thee well.

Message:  1021
<ce>              Why did _knight_ neglect to take it, %pcf?
<ce>            %oth. May I make a comment, %pct? We send our
<ce>        knights to wage war between life and death every day.
<ce>        Carelessness leads to the grave. Always remember that.
<ce>                     And please accept my thanks.

<ce>     As you step into the tavern, loud shouting greets your ears.
<ce>
<ce>          "Yeah?! Not the first knight I've killed! I'll do
<ce>               a dozen of 'em before the month's out!"
                                     <--->
<ce>     As you step into the tavern, loud shouting greets your ears.
<ce>
<ce>        "Moron knight! Who plays cards without carrying money?
<ce>                        Good riddance, I say."
                                     <--->
<ce>     As you step into the tavern, loud shouting greets your ears.
<ce>
<ce>              "Stupid knights who bet wrong, that's who.
<ce>                 ==qgiver_ aren't going to miss 'em."

Message:  1023
<ce>                       This is _knight_'s body.
<ce>               Something has gone terribly wrong here.

Message:  1024
<ce>                 You have slain _knight_'s murderer.
<ce>             At the very least, honor has been restored.

Message:  1025
<ce>                You mean to say _knight_ was murdered
<ce>            in a tavern? %oth. How do members of our order
<ce>        let these things happen? How will we vanquish the Dark
<ce>          Brotherhood, the Thieves Guild, the Necromancers,
<ce>         the vampires, and all that plague Tamriel if this is
<ce>             the quality we offer? Forgive my bitterness.
<ce>            You have done us a favor in slaying the knave.
