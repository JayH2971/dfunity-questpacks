<ce>              A remote shrine in %crn has been suffering
<ce>          some raucous interruptions by a group of brigands.
<ce>           The place needs a guard but the attendant can't
<ce>        afford the Fighters Guild's help. Will you protect it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                    What would the %t want, %pct?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               The place is called ___cult_. The priest
<ce>     has described a common scene concerning thugs and vagabonds,
<ce>    namely, they arrive every few days to shake down the visitors
<ce>      for coin and valuables before departing. It's quite likely
<ce>     you'll need to loiter for some time before they show up. As
<ce>     always, ensure you do not sleep on the premises. We speak of
<ce>    a temple, after all. Arrive within =timer_ days and stay until
<ce>             the matter is resolved. Safe travels, %pct.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 You were to defend ___cult_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>        Fine work, %pcf. I am proud to associate with knights
<ce>      such as yourself. You honor our role as guardians of %crn.

Message:  1010
<ce>        The attendant approaches and informs you that the dead
<ce>      match his recollection of the band's numbers. He gives you
<ce>   a thorough and heartfelt thanks before returning to his duties.

Message:  1011
<ce>              This is the place. Presumably you'll need
<ce>                to wait close by for the next attack.
