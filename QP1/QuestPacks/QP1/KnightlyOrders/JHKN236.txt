QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>             A pair of centaurs has been raiding a remote
<ce>        home in the wilderness of %crn. By our honor, we must
<ce>                defend the defenseless who live there.
<ce>             Will you take up our banner for this cause?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                      I refuse to believe that.
<ce>                You don't understand their suffering.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>         I'll mark ___place_ on your map. Go there and, with
<ce>          any luck, you'll find the centaurs somewhere near
<ce>               the property. Slay them and return here.
<ce>            Without word of your victory in =timer_ days,
<ce>         I'll send other, quicker knights to take your place.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                _qgiver_ expected word of your slaying
<ce>                         the centaurs by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              Ah, and with proof, even! Well done, %pcf.
<ce>                 You do us much honor with your work.

Message:  1010
<ce>              You arrive at ___place_ and find that the
<ce>           centaurs are camped out on the property, waiting
<ce>         for hapless prey to appear. It seems they'll settle
<ce>                           for you instead.

Message:  1011
<ce>       The centaurs have been slain. You decide to take a tooth
<ce>          from one of their carcasses as proof of the deed.
