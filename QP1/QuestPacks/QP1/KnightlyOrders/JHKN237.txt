<ce>               Ah, this may suit you. An ice atronach,
<ce>           a golem-like creature, is attacking residents of
<ce>       a religious site in %crn. We assured them that we would
<ce>       send aid when possible. I hope you can fulfill our duty.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>        Your honor will be given to a far less capable knight.
<ce>                   This task is mindlessly simple.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>            Yes! A righteous answer in a righteous cause.
<ce>         The site is called ___place_. Go there and find the
<ce>        creature in the streets somewhere. Grant it no mercy,
<ce>       for it does not live; it is no more than magicka within
<ce>           a frame of ice. Return here within =timer_ days,
<ce>                and we will recognize your good work.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                _qgiver_ expected word of your slaying
<ce>                         the atronach by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            Fine work! You have saved lives by undertaking
<ce>        this journey. Though this weapon may be a poor reward,
<ce>               it is a symbol of our esteem toward you.

<ce>           Somewhere in these streets, the atronach roams.
<ce>              Finding it will be a mere matter of time.

Message:  1011
<ce>            A harsh yell nearby alerts you to a struggle.
<ce>                   People flee from some assailant.
<ce>             It takes you little effort to recognize that
<ce>                      the atronach has appeared.

Message:  1012
<ce>         The residents of this community need fear no longer.
<ce>               Where the atronach came from eludes you,
<ce>           but you trust that question will be answered by
<ce>                     the appropriate authorities.
