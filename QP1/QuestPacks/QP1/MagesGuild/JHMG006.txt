<ce>           %pcf, we believe we have a simple task for you.
<ce>           One of our members brought back this _tri_ that
<ce>      we consider to have magical properties. However, ordinary
<ce>     identification spells fail us, and testing it directly seems
<ce>       like a dangerously absurd proposition, knowing it could
<ce>          hold any effect in Tamriel. What the Odylic Mages
<ce>           cannot identify, one of our greater experts can.
<ce>                Please deliver it for identification.
                                     <--->
<ce>             One of the grandiose mysteries of Tamriel is
<ce>            that there are simply forms of magic and power
<ce>            we do not yet understand. My sincerest desire
<ce>           is that the empire will last another 1500 years
<ce>             so we may have time to unravel every enigma
<ce>               across the world itself in peace. But to
<ce>              get to the point, a very strange _tri_ was
<ce>          delivered to us recently with a latent enchantment
<ce>            we cannot draw out. The regular identification
<ce>          spells avail us nothing. This requires the help of
<ce>            a true expert. Will you take it into the ruins
<ce>                    to obtain that manner of aid?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          Even so, we refuse to test it in this guild hall.
<ce>                       The risks are too great.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>      Very well, here it is. I would ask you not to tamper with
<ce>      it, but I doubt you could in any case. If our specialists
<ce>       could not unleash its power, so much less will you. You
<ce>                will most likely find _npc_ in a hole
<ce>           called ___dung_. Please treat %g2 with respect,
<ce>     for %g1 is a former member of the Guild. We do not want some
<ce>   controversy to arise merely because someone cannot control %pg3
<ce>       tongue. I will see you here within =timer_ days to hear
<ce>                 _npc_'s report. %god watch over you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                       _qgiver_ scowls at you.
<ce>
<ce>              "One of our members used your position as
<ce>                  a reference to scry into ___dung_
<ce>             and see how _npc_ was doing with the _tri_.
<ce>           No one expected to see %g3 dead corpse instead.
<ce>               I'd have you thrown in prison had I time
<ce>                  to prove my case. Begone, churl."

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              Oh my, our poor _npc_! What an awful trap!
<ce>          We owe you much this day, %pct. Had you slain %g2,
<ce>       we would have lost one of our foremost experts on arcane
<ce>       artifacts. Well done, my child! Please take this reward
<ce>         for uncovering the secret within the _tri_. What we
<ce>              do with it is now in the council's hands.

Message:  1010
<ce>           "Ah, good day. Yes, I am _npc_. What do you need
<ce>    of me? Hmm. Well, I suppose I can take a look at it. It's just
<ce>     this _tri_? Very well. Allow me to work on it for a moment."
<ce>
<ce>    You hold the trinket in front of %g2, which %g1 touches while
<ce>    chanting an incantation. A burst of light follows which leaves
<ce>    you unsettled. Once your eyes adjust, you see a very different
<ce>                      demeanor on _npc_'s face.
<ce>
<ce>        "Filthy, disgusting %ra! This is my home! What are you
<ce>      doing in my home?! Murder! Murder! This day to Oblivion!"
                                     <--->

<ce>          "%oth! Filthy cur, this day you meet your end! For
<ce>     Oblivion and its ten thousand chanting godly servants! Die!"

Message:  1011
<ce>           _npc_ lies dead. You put the _tri_ in your pack.

Message:  1012
<ce>                _npc_ halts midstep. Lucidity appears
<ce>               to return to %g3 eyes, and %g1 trembles.
<ce>
<ce>          "Oh, my. Oh, dear. I didn't hurt you, did I? What
<ce>      an awful, awful trap was put on this simple little thing!
<ce>         One of us could have been killed! Oh, I feel faint.
<ce>               Tell _qgiver_ we now know everything we
<ce>         need to about that device. And tell %g2 to burn it.
<ce>         I would do so myself if I weren't convinced it would
<ce>             rouse the Archmagister's wrath. Go in peace,
<ce>               %ra, and thank you for sparing my life."

Message:  1013
<ce>           Magical power continues to shoot from the _tri_.
<ce>                   You can't tell exactly what it's
<ce>                  doing, but it can't be beneficial.
<ce>                If you were confident in your ability,
<ce>                you could attempt to dampen the magic
<ce>                      at its source. Do you try?
<ce>
<ce>                (SKILL CHECK: YES: Thaumaturgy, high)

<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>              You turn the _tri_'s power against itself.
<ce>                            It goes inert.

Message:  1015
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>            You try to turn the _tri_'s power against it,
<ce>           but it glows all the more, and starts to bounce
<ce>         of its own power. _npc_ shrieks in an inhumane tone,
<ce>
<ce>                         "Imbecile! Stop it!
<ce>                        Stop hurting my home!"
<ce>
<ce>            Light bursts out of the trinket again, and you
<ce>               sense other beings have appeared nearby.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 The Mages Guild of ___qgiver_
 has tasked me with taking some
 _tri_ to _npc_, who is
 in __dung_, for inspection.
 I should return in =timer_ days
 with the report.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 _npc_ went berserk after
 activating the _tri_, and
 I slew %g2.

Message:  1032
%qdt:
 _npc_ suffered the

 and survived. Now I can take the
 report back to the Mages Guild.
