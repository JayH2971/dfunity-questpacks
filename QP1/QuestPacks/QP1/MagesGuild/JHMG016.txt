<ce>           My good %pcf, may I tell you concerning _mage_?
<ce>             I love _mage_, and I hate %g2. %g1 has done
<ce>             great work for the Mages Guild in the past,
<ce>          and therefore should not be abandoned in %g3 hour
<ce>            of need. Nevertheless, some experiments simply
<ce>      cannot be allowed to proceed, regardless of the pretended
<ce>             societal benefit. Will you travel to ___res_
<ce>                    to shake some sense into %g2?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>          What a bother. Are you interested in work, truly?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Our beloved colleague spends %g3 time in
<ce>                   _res_ of ___res_. I know of the
<ce>       subject matter, but I do not speak it aloud, for I know
<ce>         some will not recover from the shame of having their
<ce>       acts voiced abroad. I merely say %g1 needs to stop, now.
<ce>         Please make haste. You will be held responsible for
<ce>            _mage_'s life, and I request you do not return
<ce>                   without %g2. Safe travels, %pct.

<ce>                     _mage_ falls dead. What will
<ce>                        you tell _qgiver_ now?

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  _mage_! Oh, how I wish to censure
<ce>              you right here and now! But I well see you
<ce>              need to recover, and then I will give you
<ce>               the finest tongue-lashing of the month.
<ce>              My joy and my fury fight for control of my
<ce>                words. I will see you in a few hours,
<ce>                     when you have had some rest.
<ce>
<ce>                  As for you, %pcf, I bestow on you
<ce>                 this enchanted _reward_. Finest work
<ce>                          across the board.

QuestorPostFailure:  [1009]
I remember _mage_. No thanks to you.
<--->
Ah, if only we had _mage_'s help right now. What a shame.

Message:  1010
<ce>                    _mage_ appears to be in a sort
<ce>                 of torpor. It's hard to tell whether
<ce>                   %g1 controls the imp or the imp
<ce>                            controls %g2.

Message:  1011
<ce>               Once the imp falls, _mage_'s eyes open,
<ce>               and %g1 looks at you with consternation.
<ce>              You begin to explain your task, but before
<ce>              you can say much, you hear a noise nearby.
<ce>            In its final moments, the imp points a trinket
<ce>                   at _mage_, which crumbles under
<ce>                           strain of power.

Message:  1015
<ce>                      _mage_'s face turns pale.
<ce>
<ce>             "That... carried an infectious enchantment.
<ce>            I've been diseased and my magicka has departed
<ce>            from me. Please, I need to be cured. Help me!
<ce>             Cast a spell! A temple will do me no good!"
<ce>
<ce>           Then %g1 begins sweating and breathing heavily.

Message:  1016
<ce>                _mage_ moans, %g3 footsteps faltering.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 _mage_ nearly stumbles. You help %g2
<ce>                regain %g3 footing before continuing.
                                     <--->
<ce>             _mage_ spends several seconds in a coughing
<ce>             fit before wearily beginning to move again.

Message:  1017
<ce>                 _mage_ speaks with %g3 eyes closed.
<ce>                  You understand very little of it.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 _mage_ speaks with %g3 eyes closed.
<ce>                    The words are merely whispers.

Message:  1018
<ce>                    _mage_'s breathing is shallow.
<ce>               You help prop %g2 up as you keep moving.
                                     <--->
<ce>                _mage_ begins shaking uncontrollably.
                                     <--->
<ce>            _mage_ falls to %g3 feet and vomits profusely.
<ce>                You help %g2 back up and continue on.

Message:  1020
<ce>          A flash of light begins to consume _mage_'s body.
<ce>
<ce>                   "It's a trap! I'm being sent to
<ce>                       ___dung_! Please help!"
<ce>
<ce>               A moment later, %g1 is gone. Some nearby
<ce>                 scribbles show ___dung_'s location.

Message:  1021
<ce>                  _mage_ comes into view, apparently
<ce>                  searching for the exit. With great
<ce>                       relief %g1 waves to you.
<ce>
<ce>            "Oh, my, thank you for coming here to find me.
<ce>          The daft artifact left me without magicka, leaving
<ce>          flight as my only option in this cave. Please take
<ce>               me to ___qgiver_. I suppose a word with
<ce>              _qgiver_ would do me well at this point."

Message:  1022
<ce>                 Color returns to _mage_'s face, and
<ce>                    %g1 walks with ordinary vigor.
<ce>
<ce>            "%oth! Never could I have imagined my research
<ce>               ending so! Take me to ___qgiver_. I have
<ce>                 much to say to _qgiver_. Thank you."

Message:  1023
<ce>            Injuring the imp seems to stun it momentarily.
<ce>       Assuming this creature was summoned, it surely must have
<ce>                 some control words to make it stop.
<ce>                  Do you try to gain control of it?
<ce>
<ce>                  (SKILL CHECK: YES: Impish, difficulty medium)

Message:  1024
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>             You shout out some commands, part guesswork,
<ce>            part past knowledge flowing through your mind.
<ce>         The imp's face freezes over, and it stops attacking.
<ce>        You then dismiss it to another part of the residence.
<ce>
<ce>                 _mage_ soon returns to reality, and
<ce>         kneels before you. "Thank you, thank you, thank you!
<ce>           The creature rebelled against me and had me here
<ce>             for hours. What a disaster you have averted!
<ce>               Yes, I'm certain _qgiver_ has some words
<ce>                   for me. Lead on, and I will go."

Message:  1025
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>            Whatever you said, it had the opposite effect.
<ce>          The imp foams with rage, and then turns to _mage_
<ce>           and slashes %g2 severely. In %g3 weakened state,
<ce>       %g1 can't withstand the blow, and tumbles to the floor.

Message:  1026
<ce>                  Do you wish to give up this quest?

Message:  1027
<ce>                       _qgiver_ is not pleased,
<ce>           but you are permitted to abdicate all the same.

Message:  1028
<ce>           Within this residence you hear weak groaning and
<ce>                    the telltale growl of an imp.
<ce>                Whatever is afoot here can't be good.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 I have been assigned to bring _mage_
 of ___res_ back to the Mages Guild
 of ___qgiver_. Whatever happens, I will
 be responsible for my colleague's safety.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 _mage_ has been transported to
 ___dung_ by %g3 own trickery.

Message:  1032
%qdt: 
 _mage_ is suffering from a
 severe arcane disease, the likes of which
 a temple cannot cure. I should be able
 to dispel it with a Cure Disease spell
 of my own.
