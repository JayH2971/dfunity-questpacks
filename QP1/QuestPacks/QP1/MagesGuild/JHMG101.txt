<ce>                My dear %pcf, we often tell our newest
<ce>            inductees to the guild, "Too much power in too
<ce>               little time has destroyed many." Sadly,
<ce>                not all our students take heed of that
<ce>               warning, and we currently have a bit of
<ce>               a situation on our hands because of it.
<ce>                   For a copy of a book, we request
<ce>                  your help in culling a student too
<ce>                  well-versed in Illusion magic for
<ce>                           one's own good.
                                     <--->
<ce>               I regret to speak of this matter, but it
<ce>                is a necessary task. The Mages Guild,
<ce>                 wielding all the power that it does,
<ce>              assumes responsibility for any misuse that
<ce>               arises out of its teachings. On occasion
<ce>                there is no solution to a problematic
<ce>                 pupil except a mercy killing. The %t
<ce>                  insists that we do away with this
<ce>               shapeshifting villain. Will you help us?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                        Very well, but what if
<ce>                       you are the next target?
                                     <--->
<ce>                  Loyalty, %pct. Prove your loyalty.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   An admirable response, my child.
<ce>                     It seems this student became
<ce>                    hopped up on power after using
<ce>                 a chameleon spell for the first time
<ce>                  and found it just addictive. Then
<ce>                    came experimentation with the
<ce>                  shapeshifting spells, and suddenly
<ce>                   we have reports pouring in of a
<ce>                tiger wearing robes that kills people.
<ce>                  One of our student's friends knew
<ce>              that there was this hiding spot of resort,
<ce>                   ___dung_ in this same province.
<ce>               Go there and find our pupil, in whatever
<ce>                state as may be the case, and end this
<ce>                menace for us. You have =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>     The Mages Guild expected you to slay the illusionist by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   A thousand thanks for saving our
<ce>                 poor pupil from a worse fate. Those
<ce>                   who fail to control power become
<ce>                slaves to it in time. Have your book.

<ce>                    (ATTRIBUTE CHECK PASSED: LUCK)
<ce>
<ce>          Luck is on your side. The renegade student is both
<ce>        nearby and in normal form. You both arm yourselves for
<ce>          the battle as you hear, "You won't take me alive!"

Message:  1020
<ce>              As the creature's corpse falls, you hear a
<ce>             groan. This must have been the shapeshifter.

Message:  1021
<ce>                    This rogue student is no more.
