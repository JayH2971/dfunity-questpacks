QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>               A few weeks have passed since _scholar_
<ce>               disappeared into ___dung_ for a research
<ce>            expedition. We have need for such expertise at
<ce>           this time, and it's quite likely %g1 has merely
<ce>         lost track of time and needs to be fished out by one
<ce>               of our capable members. Will you do so?
                                     <--->
<ce>                      _scholar_, one of our more
<ce>               talented experts, has taken a temporary
<ce>                  leave to conduct research in some
<ce>              ruins. Nevertheless, we need %g2 back here
<ce>            to help with some tasks and no one is able to
<ce>              go fetch %g2. Are you willing and capable?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                I suppose you simply do not understand
<ce>             what we'll be lacking through this absence.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                A comely answer. Head on into ___dung_
<ce>                 and find _scholar_, who will likely
<ce>             need a kindly reminder that the research had
<ce>            a time limit attached. Tell %g2 to return with
<ce>              you, and be here in =timer_ or fewer days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     _qgiver_ has made clear how
<ce>              important the punctual completion of guild
<ce>           assignments is. This will reflect poorly on you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                Splendid, %pcf. _scholar_, it is a joy
<ce>            to see you safe and sound. I will receive your
<ce>           full report once you have had some rest. And as
<ce>                for you, %pct, have this book from our
<ce>                 library as a show of our gratitude.

Message:  1010
<ce>            "Hmph. Such arrogance in that voice of yours.
<ce>           I never have seen you in the guild hall, likely
<ce>            because creatures of your disposition are too
<ce>                busy munching on bones to further our
<ce>              academic purposes. I frankly do not trust
<ce>            you. Prove your intellect. Your appearance is
<ce>             not that of a worthy mage, so I need to see
<ce>               the functioning of your brain instead."
<ce>
<ce>             _scholar_ begins to pull out a quiz of some
<ce>            kind, prepared ahead of time to test visitors.
<ce>               Perhaps you could suggest an alternative
<ce>         test to save yourself time and prove your intellect.
<ce>     Do you make the suggestion (yes) or submit to the quiz (no)?
<ce>
<ce>           (ATTRIBUTE CHECK: YES: Intelligence, very high)
                                     <--->
<ce>            "Hmph. As if I would listen to a cave creature
<ce>           with your appearance. Yes, yes, I hear you, that
<ce>                 _qgiver_ wants me back, but who are
<ce>          you to tell me? A worthy mage would have a worthy
<ce>           appearance, and you have failed in that respect.
<ce>           I should sooner silence and slay you, but I must
<ce>            entertain the outlandish possibility that you
<ce>                   are actually here on %g3 errand.
<ce>              So indulge me in my questions, mageling."

<ce>                       (ATTRIBUTE CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>           You suggest a game of logic, drawn on the floor.
<ce>             Intrigued, _scholar_ decides to take you up
<ce>           on it. You place beads on the ground and explain
<ce>        how each piece is captured. You quickly win the game,
<ce>          and %g1 insists on another. You win a second time,
<ce>            and then a third. "Preposterous," %g1 mutters.
<ce>         "But it's true. You are no mental slouch. Even with
<ce>            the guild's reduced standards nowadays, I can
<ce>                  tell a proper specimen in action."

<ce>                       (ATTRIBUTE CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>           You suggest a game of logic, drawn on the floor.
<ce>             Intrigued, _scholar_ decides to take you up
<ce>           on it. You place beads on the ground and explain
<ce>              how each piece is captured. You think you
<ce>        have a good strategy, but %g1 quickly turns it around
<ce>        on you and bests you at every turn. You lose the first
<ce>             game, tie on the second, and lose the third.
<ce>             "Trivial," _scholar_ huffs. "You should have
<ce>           at least picked a game you were good at, to give
<ce>         yourself a fighting chance. I won't even bother with
<ce>               the quiz. You wouldn't pass it anyway."

<ce>                         "Ambiguity" is five.
<ce>                Therefore, "amelioration" must be six.

<ce>                          "Book" is eleven.
<ce>                  Therefore, "reward" must be four.

Message:  1037
<ce>                    The "Ghost Form" spell is sold
<ce>                      by the Mages Guild and not
<ce>                       the Temple of Kynareth.

Message:  1038

<ce>                  Legends among the Mages Guild say
<ce>                 summoning Sheogorath is easier when
<ce>                       there's thunder outside.

Message:  1044
<ce>                   The Daedric Artifact bestowed by
<ce>                  Hircine is a powerful black mace.

Message:  1046
<ce>              Just as I thought. Go back to the Fighters
<ce>              Guild and smash some more rodents for pay.
<ce>             I will remain here until I see fit to leave.

Message:  1047
<ce>           Your appearance has most certainly deceived me,
<ce>             but only a worthy mage could answer so. Lead
<ce>                the way. I have much to tell _qgiver_.

Message:  1048
<ce>                  You couldn't convince _scholar_ to
<ce>            return with you? How hard could it be? This is
<ce>       truly a disappointment. I will credit you for reminding
<ce>          %g2 to return here in a timely fashion, but I fear
<ce>       I can give you no more than that. Better luck next time.
