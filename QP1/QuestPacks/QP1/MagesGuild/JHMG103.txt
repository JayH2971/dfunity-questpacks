QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>           Have you ever heard of the Psijic Order, %pct?
<ce>   Few of our members would have. They tend to stay
<ce>   in the shadows, letting things transpire naturally...
<ce>   until they don't. One of their kind has stolen from us
<ce>   and taken refuge in a cave, for Oblivion knows
<ce>   what reason. Go and bring back our book.
<ce>   You are authorized to kill.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>    Well, I suppose a coward wouldn't want
<ce>   to face a rival order's wrath.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>       Good. If we allow this to happen, we open the door
<ce>  to more theft and loss. Whatever you decide to do
<ce>  to this Psijic thief is your own choice.
<ce>  The book will be needed in around =timer_ days' time,
<ce>  so be certain to not dally. ___dung_ is
<ce>  off %di from here. I'll mark it on your map
<ce>  and wish you safe travels.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>      You needed to take the book back from
<ce>  the Psijic Order by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>     Very fine work. I trust you encountered no
<ce>   great danger in ___dung_? Not for
<ce>   one of your prowess, in any case.
<ce>  
<ce>  I was trying to scrounge up an acceptable
<ce>  reward while you were out. Perhaps this
<ce>  _reward_ will be of use to you?
<ce>  Very fruitful for enchantments,
<ce>  they are. Give it a try, why don't you?

QuestorPostSuccess:   [1008]
The Psijic Order must be allowed to gain no ground here.

Message:  1010
<ce>     "The book is mine! Begone!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The Psijic begins casting a spell.

Message:  1011
<ce>  Your foe is dead, but the spell is finishing now.
<ce>  With a loud roar, a portal begins to open nearby.
<ce>  
<ce>  If you were confident in your Mysticism ability,
<ce>  you could attempt to close the portal before
<ce>  anything comes through. Meddling with it
<ce>  without the proper knowledge could make
<ce>  the situation even more dangerous, though.
<ce>  
<ce>  (SKILL CHECK: Mysticism: difficulty very high)

Message:  1012
<ce>                 (SKILL CHECK PASSED!)
<ce>  
<ce>  The Psijics may know something about Mysticism,
<ce>  but so do you. You take hold of the portal and begin
<ce>  reducing its power. A clawed hand tries to reach through,
<ce>  but too late -- the connection to Oblivion has been severed.
<ce>  Whatever danger you could have faced is now past. 

Message:  1013
<ce>                (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>  
<ce>  You begin focusing on the portal to close it.
<ce>  Whether it's power or knowledge you lack, you don't know;
<ce>  but your attempts to close it give it a little
<ce>  more energy, enough to help a couple more
<ce>  demons pass through than was originally intended.
<ce>  With a loud bang, the portal finally pops out
<ce>  of existence, leaving you with some new guests.

Message:  1014
<ce>  Rather than mess with a Psijic's portal,
<ce>  you brace yourself for whatever's about to come through.
<ce>  A fire daedra confidently steps through as
<ce>  the portal runs out of power.
