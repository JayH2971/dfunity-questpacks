QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                Contrary to our vehement urging, a guild member
<ce>                has taken to seclusion in a foul hole,
<ce>               attempting to control a powerful daedra.
<ce>               This kind of ritual is always dangerous
<ce>               and never approved. We need someone with
<ce>                 good skill and proper wisdom to find
<ce>                   our friend and end this madness.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 Oh dear. We must find someone soon.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                  Expect serious peril when you go.
<ce>                This is the kind of power reserved for
<ce>              the highest tiers of the Mages Guild, and
<ce>                to even fathom controlling it in whole
<ce>                     is mere fantasy. _mage_ went
<ce>                     into ___dung_ a few days ago
<ce>                and our minds have not ceased to worry
<ce>                   for %g3 state. Please bring %g2
<ce>                   back within =timer_ days' time.
<ce>              If you follow the gods, seek their help as
<ce>             you go. No one can predict what will happen.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                      Hmm? I do not see _mage_.
<ce>                 Return here when that changes, %pct.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                       _qgiver_ calls for a few
<ce>             attendants, who rush in from nearby rooms to
<ce>                     take _mage_ off your hands.
<ce>
<ce>            "My word, %pcf, you have done the impossible.
<ce>             Fifty other guild members we could have sent
<ce>               would not have known what to do. Neither
<ce>            thanks nor congratulations will do, my friend.
<ce>              A diamond seems to me a pittance but will
<ce>                 hopefully compensate your travail."

<ce>                     _mage_ appears to be in deep
<ce>             concentration. You try to get %g3 attention.
<ce>
<ce>             Then something goes wrong. Crackles of power
<ce>              shoot from %g3 body in various directions.
<ce>                 The room momentarily pulses darker.
<ce>                 As %g3 eyes shoot open, %g1 shouts.
<ce>
<ce>                 "N-no! It wasn't finished! You fool!
<ce>                        For distracting me..."
<ce>
<ce>                 You become aware of a daedra nearby,
<ce>             a powerful one. Through sheer mental effort
<ce>                     _mage_ appears to be holding
<ce>                             it in place.

Message:  1011
<ce>               "Release me," the daedra shouts at you.
<ce>                 "Slay the fool who has summoned me,
<ce>                   and I will return to my realm."
<ce>
<ce>                      "No! Do not listen to it!"
<ce>                      _mage_ shouts in response.
<ce>                   "This creature is dangerous and
<ce>                    must not be given free reign!
<ce>                          Do not interfere!"

Message:  1012
<ce>                  The daedra and mage begin to shout
<ce>                 at each other in various languages.
<ce>                        Oddly, _mage_'s voice
<ce>                   and the monster's begin to meld.
<ce>                   They soon sound very much alike.
<ce>
<ce>                "You will not win! This is my realm!"
<ce>
<ce>                "Stop this madness! I am the victor!"
<ce>
<ce>               You sense sheer arcane power pouring out
<ce>              from both beings. If the daedra is right,
<ce>               it will leave this realm once freed from
<ce>              the spell. If not, interfering could have
<ce>              serious consequences. This is well beyond
<ce>                     your ken. What will you do?

Message:  1013
<ce>                 _mage_'s eyes turn red. From %g3 and
<ce>               the daedra's mouth come the same words.
<ce>
<ce>               "I am =daed_, lord of Oblivion! I cannot
<ce>             be slain! Aid me and I will grant you power!
<ce>                      Free me from these bands!"

Message:  1014
<ce>                  _mage_ yells with great intensity
<ce>           and fights back against =daed_'s mental assault.
<ce>           Gaining power back, first imperceptibly and then
<ce>           at a growing pace, the mage finishes the binding
<ce>            spell and returns the daedra to its own realm
<ce>                   with a blinding flash of light.
<ce>
<ce>                You feel exhausted merely by watching
<ce>                  the spectacle, but the summoner is
<ce>                      completely drained. _mage_
<ce>                only has energy enough to mutter some
<ce>          choice words against you before entering a torpor.
<ce>         You gather up %g3 inert form and take %g2 with you.

Message:  1015
<ce>              You strike the daedra, and the mental link
<ce>                     shares the pain with _mage_.
<ce>            In that moment of weakness %g3 guard is down,
<ce>            and the monster takes the opportunity to blast
<ce>               %g3 mind from the inside. You watch %g3
<ce>                      body crumple to the floor.
<ce>
<ce>              "Well done, feeble creature! Now I am free
<ce>                 to traverse this world as I please!"
<ce>       It owes you no gratitude, and marches to kill you next.
<ce>
<ce>           You'll have to tell the Mages Guild about this.

Message:  1016
<ce>                     You strike _mage_ and break
<ce>                 %g3 concentration. In that moment of
<ce>                 weakness %g3 guard is down, and the
<ce>                monster takes the opportunity to blast
<ce>               %g3 mind from the inside. You watch %g3
<ce>             body crumple to the floor. The daedra roars
<ce>                            with laughter.
<ce>
<ce>              "Well done, feeble creature! Now I am free
<ce>                 to traverse this world as I please!"

Message:  1017
<ce>               This is simply awful. I feared the worst
<ce>              and received it in turn. If nothing else,
<ce>              we now have a cautionary tale for so many
<ce>                aspirants who come through our doors.
<ce>                  Thank you for going, %pcf, though
<ce>                         I cannot reward you.
