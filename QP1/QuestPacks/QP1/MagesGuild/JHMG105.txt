QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>    Ah! If you have some time to spare, there's a
<ce>  special invitation we received from a Nord mage,
<ce>  arrived from the east. Came to share some magical
<ce>  knowledge, in return for some knowledge of our own.
<ce>  I'd rather not bother some of our more intensive
<ce>  scholars with the task, so if you're fit for travel,
<ce>  perhaps you could meet with him or her.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>         Hmm. I hope we can send someone worthy
<ce>  of the Mages Guild's reputation.
<ce>   You would've been a good choice.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>   Ah, what a joy! Well, that relieves me greatly.
<ce>  For this person to arrive in the Iliac Bay and
<ce>  find no competent spellcasters would have
<ce>  shamed the entire Council.
<ce>  I forgot to write down the name, but
<ce>  this person is waiting in _tav_
<ce>  at ___tav_. Look for someone who sticks out
<ce>  among the crowd, some =mage_.
<ce>  I don't know how much we'll be able to pay you,
<ce>  but we'll try to scrounge up your traveling expenses
<ce>  by the time you return, at least.
<ce>  And remember, %pct, to find joy in the journey.
<ce>  Sometimes the very experience is all the reward we get.
<ce>  Be sure to arrive within =timer_ days, lest
<ce>  this mage depart and we lose a good opportunity for fellowship.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>   The =mage_ of ___tav_ will have left by now.

QuestComplete:   [1004]
<ce>  At least you gained quite a bit of knowledge from this.

Message:  1010
<ce>    %pcn! How was your journey? Did you learn something
<ce>  from the mysterious traveler? I'll have you know,
<ce>  I was dutiful in begging every single person to come through
<ce>  our doors for some pittance to pay you with,
<ce>  while on your errand to build the guild's reputation.
<ce>  You may not be duly impressed with the =reward_ gold pieces
<ce>  I gathered, but they are yours nonetheless.
<ce>  Our thanks to you, %pct. The Council will
<ce>  receive a letter detailing your exploits,
<ce>  with my exceeding approbation.

Message:  1011
<ce>  This =mage_ squints at you, trying to perceive your intent.
<ce>  You introduce yourself as the ambassador of the Mages Guild.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Ah! Finely met, my associate. I feared that no one would
<ce>  answer my call. Perhaps you'll forgive me for taking your time,
<ce>  but I fully intend to pull from your mind all that I can
<ce>  while you still stand. And you are free to take from me what my breath imparts."
<ce>  
<ce>  The din of the tavern seems to fade as %g1 asks several direct,
<ce>  probing questions concerning principles of magic. Owing to %g3 distinct
<ce>  schooling, you find yourself approaching the schools of magic
<ce>  from various unexpected directions. New insights seem to jump
<ce>  out at you which should have been obvious. Hours pass, during which
<ce>  %g1 never seems to tire.
<ce>  
<ce>  Finally, %g1 yawns and says, "A shame we don't have days to pass here.
<ce>  I'm headed southward soon, and must gather provisions for the journey.
<ce>  My thanks to you for generously imparting a few hours to this foolish
<ce>  vagrant; I pray that your time was as well spent as mine."
<ce>  
<ce>  With a reverent bow and a wave, your newfound friend bids you depart.
<ce>  You feel your mind filled with fascinating new concepts
<ce>  that you wouldn't have learned otherwise.

%qdt:
 _questgiver_ asked me to represent
 the Mages Guild with a traveling scholar,
 a =mage_ staying in _tav_
 at ___tav_. I should meet %g2 within
 =timer_ days, after which I suppose
 I may return to ___questgiver_ at my leisure.
