QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>           %pcf, do you like hearing from the %t? I do not.
<ce>          Most guild members also do not. Our research must
<ce>          not be interrupted by petty squabbles such as some
<ce>             mere murderer holed up in some ruins, as is
<ce>         the case at this moment. We received a request this
<ce>      morning to slay one such criminal that the Fighters Guild
<ce>        simply could not locate. Knowing of your combat skill,
<ce>           we wish to bestow this task upon you for the sum
<ce>         of =reward_ gold pieces. Are you ready to teleport?
                                     <--->
<ce>              Surely, it must be said that the %t takes
<ce>      advantage of us at times. It's not as though there aren't
<ce>         plenty of dashing, youthful adventurers across %crn
<ce>           willing to slay a criminal in a hole for money.
<ce>            Nevertheless, their incompetence lays the task
<ce>          instead at our feet. We have been given the order
<ce>               of disposing of an outlaw in some ruins,
<ce>          who must be surprised by the use of teleportation.
<ce>            Apparently all other means have failed to find
<ce>          the knave. If you are willing and ready, we should
<ce>       like to teleport you this instant to get this over with.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                     %oth. No one is, apparently.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>           Then we will send you off immediately. Our good
<ce>                   _dummy_ will do the incantation.
<ce>             Regrettably, we cannot pinpoint the precise
<ce>            location of your foe, so you'll have a bit of
<ce>                     spelunking to do to find it.
<ce>            I don't so much care about when you come back,
<ce>              so long as you come back alive. Let the %t
<ce>           take responsibility for these things sooner than
<ce>         bother us again. Once you're off I can say our work
<ce>       is in progress. Well then, I won't hold you any further.
<ce>                          Go ahead, _dummy_.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               It happens to the best of us, I suppose.
<ce>                        Better luck next time.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>           Oh, %pcf, I am overjoyed at your return. The %t
<ce>         sent a few missives while we waited, and I rejoiced
<ce>   to reply with certain choice words not fit for this guild hall.
<ce>       I feel to reject such petitions in the future, had I the
<ce>       confidence this building would not be closed upon within
<ce>     the week. You have certainly earned your reward. Thank you.

<ce>  (Hint: You may be in a location that's impossible to escape from,)
<ce>                 (like the bottom of a chute. If so,)
<ce>   (make a save and try the console command "teleport" to get out.)
<ce>
<ce>     Somewhere in this dark hole, you have an assassin to locate.
<ce>       You could wander around until you bump into each other,
<ce>        or perhaps you could set a trap to see if you can get
<ce>       your foe to come to you. Do you try to set a trap (yes)
<ce>                     or search on your own (no)?
<ce>
<ce>                 (SKILL CHECK: YES: Stealth, difficulty medium)

Message:  1011
<ce>       You're back, and you have no proof of a slain criminal.
<ce>                  Do you wish to give up this task?

Message:  1012
<ce>                     Very well then. Off you go.

Message:  1013
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>             Using a few pieces of litter nearby, you arm
<ce>         a noise trap that sounds a few steps away from you.
<ce>        You hear a single person approach, and then the words,
<ce>
<ce>                         "Is someone there?"

Message:  1014
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>          You gather a few pieces of litter nearby and start
<ce>         to work on a noise trap. However, you're not nearly
<ce>                    as quiet as you think you are.
<ce>         Multiple footsteps approach, and one person shouts,
<ce>
<ce>                  "We heard something! Who is it?!"
<ce>
<ce>             Your quarry still eludes you, unfortunately.

Message:  1015
<ce>            If you get moving now, you have the advantage
<ce>              on your target. It's time to go searching.
