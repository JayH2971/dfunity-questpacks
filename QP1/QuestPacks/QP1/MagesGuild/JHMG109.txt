<ce>                  If you will hear it, we have a bit
<ce>               of a difficulty, so to speak. The famed
<ce>                     researcher _dummy_ has left
<ce>              us a manuscript of very valuable research,
<ce>                    which needs to get to ___res_
<ce>                after =2res_ days' time. Our colleague
<ce>                     _client_ won't arrive until
<ce>              then, so the documents must be kept safe.
<ce>                  We have good reason to believe the
<ce>               Thieves Guild will pursue their carrier.
<ce>               Will you escort these papers, knowing of
<ce>                     the danger surrounding them?
                                     <--->
<ce>              We have need of a delivery, but only after
<ce>                certain days have passed. We have here
<ce>                    papers from the great _dummy_
<ce>                     that need to get to ___res_
<ce>              after =2res_ days have passed. Meanwhile,
<ce>               it's quite likely the Thieves Guild will
<ce>               attempt to waylay whoever carries them.
<ce>                Can you provide them a safe delivery?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 I certainly hope our guild hall can
<ce>              withstand the Thieves Guild's intrusions.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     How wonderful! _client_ will
<ce>             have a sum of money for you once you arrive.
<ce>               I don't know what you'll do to keep the
<ce>            papers safe, but you'll use your best thinking
<ce>               to accomplish it. Be cautious around the
<ce>              Thieves Guild. They are not accustomed to
<ce>              fighting so much as stealing, and I worry
<ce>                that offending them will not be easily
<ce>                forgotten. But whatever you do, do not
<ce>                  give up that manuscript. May %god
<ce>                watch over you these next =2res_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                       Good. We're outta here.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                  Good day. What have we here? Ah, a
<ce>                    sample of _dummy_'s fine work.
<ce>                Let me check whether it has %g3 seal.
<ce>                Well, it appears to be in proper order
<ce>                  and condition. Send my regards to
<ce>                        _qgiver_. Here is your
<ce>                 payment. A pleasure speaking to you.

<ce>                       You hear voices nearby.

<ce>                         "There %pg is. Go."

Message:  1011
<ce>             Don't toy with us here. We're Thieves Guild.
<ce>                Just give us the papers and get lost.
<ce>               We'll put in a good word for you, squid.

Message:  1012
<ce>                   You wanna do this the hard way?
<ce>                      We'll do it the hard way.

Message:  1013
<ce>                     If _qgiver_ spoke correctly,
<ce>                     _client_ should have arrived
<ce>                           at _res_ by now.

<ce>             A youth attempts to be sneaky while putting
<ce>                a piece of paper into your hands. Some
<ce>                  must still be learning the craft.

<ce>
  Some of us think trying to kill you is going to be easy.
Others think they can persuade those notes away from
you. I say they're fools and I have a better solution.
<ce>
  Come over to _near_ and pay me
400 gold. I'll get the Thieves Guild to think you're
carrying some other papers. Otherwise you're gonna
have some trouble on the way to ___res_.

Message:  1022
<ce>                         Yeah? Oh, it's you.
<ce>
<ce>            Well, I see your sincere intentions, but what
<ce>           I don't see is 400 gold. Try paying me that and
<ce>                     I'll do what I can for you.

Message:  1023
<ce>                       Yeah? You got the money?
<ce>
<ce>              Yep, 400 straight. All right. So I'm gonna
<ce>             tell the folks setting up the ambushes that
<ce>                 it's actually gonna be the next %ra
<ce>              that comes out of the Mages Guild instead
<ce>            of you. I'll make it convincing. Don't worry.
<ce>                      Your money is well spent.
