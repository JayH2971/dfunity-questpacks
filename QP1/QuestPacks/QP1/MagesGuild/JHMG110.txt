QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              Shh, %pcf. Speak softly. We have concocted
<ce>             a mission specifically for you. It involves
<ce>          some combat, some spelunking, some teleportation,
<ce>              and absolute loyalty to the guild. Please,
<ce>               tell me you will help us in this matter.
                                     <--->
<ce>             I have a matter of the greatest sensitivity,
<ce>                %pcf. A guild member of high rank must
<ce>                be removed by force, and the task will
<ce>                require skill, intelligence, and wit.
<ce>                     Please, will you accept it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  But you are perfect for the task!
<ce>                    What can I do to persuade you?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Then let me tell you concerning the matter.
<ce>                    ___qgiver_ is home to _mark_,
<ce>                one of the most talented mages in all
<ce>               %crn. %g1 also conjures the dead for %g3
<ce>             foul purposes. If left to follow %g3 course,
<ce>                %g1 could become the new Archmagister
<ce>                with sufficient time. This cannot be.
<ce>
<ce>               Take this _gem_. It is enchanted to send
<ce>                %g2 to ___dungeon_. Do not point it at
<ce>               yourself, for it will wipe away a Recall
<ce>           effect and leave you stranded within the depths.
<ce>                         Lead _mark_ to _res_
<ce>                  at ___res_ and use it there. Then
<ce>                 follow %g2 to the cave and slay %g2.
<ce>                  You will likely not have more than
<ce>              =timer_ days once %g1 is teleported there.
<ce>                     Are you ready? Best of luck.
<ce>
<ce>                  Yoo-hoo, _mark_! Our dear %pcn is
<ce>          here to show you the experiment we are so fond of!

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                      _mark_ will have absconded
<ce>             from ___dungeon_ by now to plot %g3 revenge.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>           My word, %pcf, you have done us a great service.
<ce>            The damage the Mages Guild would have suffered
<ce>              as an institution harboring a necromancer
<ce>             in its administration would have been beyond
<ce>             description. I will inform the Archmagister.
<ce>                     Take this magical _reward_.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
That _mark_ has always been such a nice person.
<--->
They say _mark_ raises the dead.
<--->
_mark_ is a rising star in the Mages Guild.

Message:  1010
<ce>                     _mark_ comes out from one of
<ce>                the adjoining rooms, far from earshot.
<ce>
<ce>                 "You, my escort? Well, this will do.
<ce>                   Let us be off to ___res_ then."
<ce>
<ce>                      _qgiver_ smiles nervously
<ce>                     at you and wishes you luck.

Message:  1020
<ce>              "Very well, %pct. Let us be on with this.
<ce>               Show me the experiment the Archmagister
<ce>                       is so flustered about."
<ce>
<ce>                  Now is the time to use the _gem_.

Message:  1021
<ce>               You raise the _gem_ into the air, and it
<ce>                    flashes brightly. _mark_ cries
<ce>                  out in a stupor, %g3 magical force
<ce>               being drained during the teleportation.
<ce>                Within seconds the room is as before,
<ce>                    except without your colleague.
<ce>                    Now to find %g2 in ___dungeon_
<ce>                       and put an end to this.

Message:  1022
<ce>                    _mark_'s eyes burn furiously.
<ce>
<ce>                 "I knew this would happen! I knew it
<ce>                all along! Once I'm finished with you,
<ce>                    all ___qgiver_ will smolder!"
<ce>
<ce>                      %g1 casts an incantation.

Message:  1023
<ce>                      _mark_'s body slumps down.
<ce>                   The battle is over. You take %g3
<ce>                 official seal as proof of the deed.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ has given me
 a secret mission regarding
 one _mark_ of the Mages Guild
 in ___qgiver_. We must
 travel together to ___res_
 to a home called _res_,
 where I will use a _gem_
 prepared by the Mages Guild.
 I should then travel to
 ___dungeon_ and finish the deed.

Message:  1050
<ce>                      _mark_ finds your behavior
<ce>                   too suspicious, and steps away.
<ce>
<ce>             "I've had far too many attempts on my life.
<ce>                  Whether you are %pct or Apprentice
<ce>             means nothing to me. I wish to have nothing
<ce>                           to do with you."
<ce>
<ce>               Before you can say a word, %g1 departs.
