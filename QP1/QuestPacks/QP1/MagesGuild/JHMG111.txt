<ce>                 Oh, %pcf, perhaps this may interest
<ce>                  you. One of our instructors needs
<ce>                  a guide to a few exotic locations
<ce>                 in the area. If you can merely keep
<ce>                         _guide_ and a group
<ce>                  of students safe during the =goal_
<ce>                 days the trip will take, you will be
<ce>                paid =reward_ gold. Feeling up to it?
                                     <--->
<ce>                  %pcf, how was your walk here? And
<ce>             more to the point, do you like the outdoors?
<ce>               Occasionally we send out our more feeble
<ce>             members to gain some real world experience,
<ce>             requiring some danger and some dust between
<ce>           the toes. All in the name of building character,
<ce>           of course. But while one instructor teaches them
<ce>           the way, another keeps the group safe. Will you
<ce>                     do the protecting this time?

<ce>                 Oh, drat. Why is this so difficult?

<ce>                  "Splendid! _guide_ is around here.
<ce>                 I'm sure the group will be ready to
<ce>                     go immediately. Wait here."
<ce>
<ce>                       _qgiver_ calls out, and
<ce>                from the adjoining rooms come several
<ce>                 inexperienced-looking guild members,
<ce>                  along with someone a bit older who
<ce>                       approaches you directly.
<ce>
<ce>                      "Hello %pcf. Thank you for
<ce>                taking this up for us. I'm not so much
<ce>                 for the wilderness so help like this
<ce>                   is truly invaluable. We need to
<ce>                   see a graveyard, a rural shrine,
<ce>                 and a farmstead. If we can have this
<ce>                  done within =goal_ days we will be
<ce>                happy to pay you. All right students,
<ce>               grab your gear! This time is for real!"
<ce>
<ce>                 The various guild members wrap their
<ce>               belongings into bags and mats and begin
<ce>                  to follow you as a cluttered mass.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     _guide_ looks disconcerted.
<ce>
<ce>              "You know, we are grateful for what you've
<ce>               shown us, but we had a deadline to meet.
<ce>                 We wish you luck on the return trip.
<ce>                 Come now students, it's time to go!"
<ce>
<ce>              You watch %g2 and the students trail off.

<ce>                  "Oh, this has been splendid. Kudos
<ce>                 to you, %pcf. We thank you for your
<ce>                 good attitude while putting up with
<ce>                our best efforts to keep up. I believe
<ce>              this payment has never been better earned.
<ce>             Perhaps we will ask for you in the future."
<ce>
<ce>              With a bit more confidence in themselves,
<ce>                  _guide_ and the travel-worn group
<ce>              of students meander off toward ___qgiver_.

Message:  1020
<ce>                        _guide_ speaks to the
<ce>              students, pointing out several interesting
<ce>                details about the graveyard, including
<ce>                traces of ectoplasm and other valuable
<ce>                 alchemical ingredients. You wait for
<ce>                  several minutes while the students
<ce>                take their time collecting samples and
<ce>                 attempting rudimentary experiments.
<ce>                Before long everyone looks satisfied,
<ce>                    and you get ready to move on.

Message:  1021
<ce>                      _guide_ steps forward and
<ce>                explains the existence of shrines such
<ce>              as this one. The students line up to speak
<ce>               to the attendant and make rough sketches
<ce>               of the area. Before long everyone forms
<ce>               up into a group again, ready to follow.

Message:  1022
<ce>                      _guide_ takes the students
<ce>               for a walk around the property, talking
<ce>              about the soil's conditions, the nature of
<ce>                 the plants being grown, and various
<ce>                miscellaneous facts concerning alchemy
<ce>            and quality ingredients. The students rapidly
<ce>              take down notes before gathering together.
