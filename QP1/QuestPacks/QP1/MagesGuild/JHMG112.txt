QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 %pcf, we have before us a tale told
<ce>                far too many times, as you well know.
<ce>               A member of our guild grows so powerful
<ce>                so as to flaunt every rule of decency,
<ce>                   thieving and murdering by use of
<ce>                 magical fiat. This time we speak of
<ce>                         _enmage_ of ___res_,
<ce>                  one %pct of considerable ability.
<ce>                  We fear for the safety of any sent
<ce>                  to face %g2, but we have no other
<ce>                 choice. Are you brave enough to face
<ce>                         this dangerous foe?
                                     <--->
<ce>                 A %pct of great skill has become too
<ce>               great a danger for %crn. Though sharing
<ce>                       your rank, _enmage_ has
<ce>                 dabbled too much in dangerous works
<ce>                  for too long and must be put down.
<ce>                  You will face great danger, but we
<ce>                 have a help available for you if you
<ce>               choose to accept our request. Will you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                At this point the Archmagister himself
<ce>                 may have to intervene to settle it.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   May %god stay with you from the
<ce>               moment you leave this guild hall, %pcf.
<ce>                     Go to ___res_ and find %g2.
<ce>                Hopefully the residents will tell you
<ce>                where %g1 is. We so truly hope nothing
<ce>                 evil comes of this. One of our own,
<ce>                      _aide_, was insistent you
<ce>                 speak to %g2 before leaving. You'll
<ce>               find %g2 here locally. Finish it within
<ce>                    =2res_ days and I will reward
<ce>                      you for your heroic deed.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    %oth, I actually had my doubts
<ce>             whether I would speak to you again. Please,
<ce>                 tell me the tale of the battle. Was
<ce>                        _aide_'s _thing_ worth
<ce>                the trouble? Oh, how I wish I had more
<ce>           than this _reward_ to pay you with. Spectacular
<ce>                         work, my good %pct.

Message:  1010
<ce>                Ah, so they sent %pcn. Well, I suppose
<ce>          I would have to make this public sooner or later.
<ce>               Better to make an example of you so they
<ce>             learn the meaning of fear. If you have come
<ce>            to fight me, then make your piddling attempt!

Message:  1011
<ce>                     _enmage_ smirks. A powerful
<ce>                curse begins to bind itself onto you.
<ce>                  You hope %g1 is not as powerful as
<ce>                         _qgiver_ intimated.

Message:  1012
<ce>              You have no hope of catching _enmage_ now.
<ce>         The best you can do is escape from here and hope to
<ce>                prevent this from happening next time.

Message:  1013
<ce>                          _enmage_ is dead.

Message:  1015
<ce>             %pcn! Oh, by the gods. I'm so glad you came
<ce>        to speak to me. I wish I could persuade you to run and
<ce>               never face _enmage_, but you have a duty
<ce>         to fulfill. All I ask is that you take this _thing_
<ce>        I have crafted. Tell no one concerning its power, for
<ce>           it was made using the dark arts. Once %g1 enters
<ce>            the battle stance, use it immediately. %g1 can
<ce>           spring powerful traps without anyone knowing it.
<ce>            I wish I could offer more help, but the guild
<ce>           doesn't want more than one person dying to %g2.
<ce>                       Please come back alive.

Message:  1016
<ce>              You reach for the _thing_ and activate it.
<ce>                 _enmage_'s face suddenly grows pale,
<ce>          knowing you have robbed %g2 of some of %g3 power.
<ce>           You proceed with the battle, confident of having
<ce>                      undone one of %g3 tricks.

Message:  1020
<ce>              _enmage_ will likely have escaped by now.
