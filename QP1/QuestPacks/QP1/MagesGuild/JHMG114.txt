QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 One of our local scholars, _schol_,
<ce>             has been involved in work to counteract the
<ce>               effects of vampirism. Later tonight %g1
<ce>                       will travel to _res_ to
<ce>                    collaborate with one of %crn's
<ce>               better-known vampire hunters. There must
<ce>             be a combat-ready escort for this encounter,
<ce>                and for some reason I thought of you.
<ce>                      Will you accept this task?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               Oh, bother. Back into the pile it goes.
                                     <--->
<ce>         We'll see what you say when you contract hemophilia.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>              Ah, a champion worthy of the rank of %pct.
<ce>             Very good. I fear you'll need to first track
<ce>                  down _schol_, as %g1 has wandered
<ce>                off somewhere, I believe. The dangers
<ce>                 of working with the eccentric mind.
<ce>                The two of you should arrive at _res_
<ce>                by 11:00 tonight. _hunt_ will conduct
<ce>         their meeting, and you will bring %g3 report to me.
<ce>           Do not return without it, and do not arrive late
<ce>              to the residence. Farewell, and good luck.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     You were to arrive at _res_
<ce>            by 11:00 tonight. You have missed the meeting.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>         In spite of the sacrifices made, this research will
<ce>     surely draw us closer to ending vampirism once and for all.
<ce>      Take pride in the work we are doing. This piddling reward
<ce>        does not properly reflect your work, but we insist on
<ce>              granting you something out of our stores.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
___vampres_ has a problem with vampires apparently, in _vampres_.
<--->
A bunch of vampires are consorting about _vampres_ in ___vampres_.

Message:  1010
<ce>               Ah! You, %ra? Looking for me? What for?
<ce>            Oh, that business! Yes, I agree it's certainly
<ce>            time we went off now. Forgive me for appearing
<ce>              a tad disoriented. It is not my intention,
<ce>                I swear it. Now then! Let us be going.

Message:  1011
<ce>             It appears you were tasked with good cause.
<ce>             Sounds of howling and hissing bounce off the
<ce>                       walls of the residence.
<ce>
<ce>                  _schol_, apparently quite addled,
<ce>                separates from you to assume a sort of
<ce>               battle stance. %g1 disappears from view.

Message:  1012
<ce>                  From within the residence you hear
<ce>                       _schol_ groan, and then
<ce>           the sound of something heavy hitting the ground.

Message:  1013
<ce>                _schol_ appears from around a corner.
<ce>
<ce>                "Well, wasn't that an adrenaline rush?
<ce>                No wonder they sent you! I feel awful
<ce>                for the last few who attempted to help
<ce>                      in matters of vampirism."
<ce>
<ce>          You hear %g3 voice shake. Apparently %g3 troubled
<ce>             demeanor is the result of experience rather
<ce>                          than temperament.

Message:  1014
<ce>                       You search _hunt_'s body
<ce>             and find an empty envelope, torn wide open.
<ce>                     The report has been stolen.

Message:  1015
<ce>                      _schol_ titters nervously.
<ce>
<ce>                   "It's gone? Oh, drat. Umm...
<ce>                 What do we do now? We can't just
<ce>           leave things like this... But there's nothing left!
<ce>       I will start talking to certain friends of mine and inform you
<ce>       if I learn more. %god will that they have greater purpose for that
<ce>                     report than to destroy it."
<ce>
<ce>               Taking a deep breath, %g1 stumbles away.

Message:  1020
<ce>               You need only step inside this house for
<ce>            the entire structure to erupt in angry shouts.
<ce>                   It appears the rumors were true.

Message:  1021
<ce>                      You take the report back.
<ce>              _qgiver_ will want it as soon as possible.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of The Mages Guild
 has tasked me with accompanying a
 scholar on vampirism, _schol_,
 to _res_ of ___res_
 at 11:00 tonight. I must obtain
 the hunter _hunt_'s report
 and deliver it to _qgiver_.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 We were waylaid by vampires
 in _res_. _schol_
 is dead and the report has
 gone missing. I will need to
 find this band of vampires
 and take the document back.

Message:  1032
%qdt:
 We were waylaid by vampires
 in _res_, and the
 report has gone missing.
 _schol_ intends to find out more,
 and will tell me if anything turns up.

Message:  1050
<ce>              A scraggly-looking page with flowing robes
<ce>               hands you a letter before disappearing.

Message:  1051
%pcn,
 
  I have good news to report. My probings have indicated
a vampire resort in ___vampres_ by the name of
_vampres_. I myself am detained in other
matters but I do know _qgiver_ entrusted
to you the safekeeping of _hunt_'s report.
Let us hope that the document is being stored there.
 
             _schol_
             ___res_

Message:  1060
<ce>               Welcome back, %pct. I have already heard
<ce>                concerning the passing of both _schol_
<ce>                    and _hunt_. My soul mourns for
<ce>              them, for they did great service to %crn.
<ce>                  Yet I know you failed in nothing.
<ce>          You have brought the report, which brings me joy.

Message:  1061
<ce>                Welcome back, %pct! I was filled with
<ce>                  sorrow for the passing of _hunt_,
<ce>                  but we still have you and _schol_
<ce>         among us. Some tragedies simply cannot be prevented.
<ce>        Carry yourself with pride for the work you have done.
<ce>                 I also wish to mention that _schol_
<ce>                     contributed to your reward.

Message:  1080
<ce>             This report is filled with jargon concerning
<ce>           very specialized restoration magic and alchemy.
<ce>                     You understand parts of it.
