<ce>                    %pct, have you any ability to
<ce>                 identify objects? Your spellcasting
<ce>                ability would really help us out here.
                                     <--->
<ce>              We have someone in another city possessing
<ce>                 an object that needs identification.
<ce>             Are you able and willing to cast the spell?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>         Well, it's certainly not a matter of life and death.

<ce>                 Delightful, %pcf. Poor _client_ has
<ce>         been patient with us but business must be transacted
<ce>                sooner or later. Find %g2 in ___res_.
<ce>         The object to be identified is said to be of minimal
<ce>           difficulty, which is why we have not asked it to
<ce>           be taken to a guild hall. Apparently our client
<ce>        is so busy that merely stepping outside %g3 residence
<ce>            supposes a ponderous burden. The agreed sum is
<ce>     =reward_ gold, which you are free to pocket as compensation.
<ce>         I do merely ask that you arrive within =2res_ days.
<ce>    That is what we promised, you see, and the guild's reputation
<ce>          must not be tarnished. Safe travels, my good %pct.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 _questgiver_ needed you to identify
<ce>                     _client_'s document by now.

<ce>        Once you have cast the spell, the surface of the page
<ce>          begins to blur. Previously undecipherable letters
<ce>   take their proper place, and the meaning soon becomes apparent.
<ce>
<ce>         "%oth, must this be so? It is my mother's recipe for
<ce>         gorgon snake soup. What a shame. Nevertheless, lest
<ce>       I be treated as a pariah by you and yours, I will grant
<ce>           you your money. Take it. Thank you in any case."

<ce>    Suddenly %g1 turns pale and races to pull it from your sight.
<ce>
<ce>        "That's quite enough! Not all things are meant for all
<ce>       eyes, you see. That is private property. Take your money
<ce>                   and go. Leave me to my musings."

<ce>       sending it back and forth by a courier. What a treasure!
<ce>        This is well worth the payment. Thank you, good mage."

<ce> "A recipe for a potion of Free Action. Well, this is a disappointment.
<ce>  I bet you have one of these waiting in your wagon, now don't you?
<ce>    But we agreed on a payment, and that you shall have. Take it."

<ce>"A very primitive incantation to dispel a daedra. Some of these words
<ce>    are actually made up. This looks entirely useless, I believe.
<ce>     Nevertheless, I will pay you as we agreed. Fare thee well."

<ce>     "'The Dark Brotherhood has been watching you. You have slain
<ce>     without sanction several times. You must now join us, or be
<ce>   counted as our foe.' Well, this answers some of my long-standing
<ce>       questions about my father. What a sorry state of things.
<ce>     But I do thank you for coming out here. Take your payment."

Message:  1010
<ce>          _client_ ignores you for several moments, clearly
<ce>    caught up in other work. You wait until %g3 attention shifts.
<ce>
<ce>       "Yes? Oh, from the Mages Guild, I see. Well, here it is.
<ce>     This is a document I've held in storage for quite some time.
<ce>    It carries an enchantment that mixes its letters, rendering it
<ce>     unreadable. I need to have it legible and at my disposition.
<ce>       When you are ready, cast the spell and I will read it."
                                     <--->
<ce>           _client_ is slightly startled by your approach,
<ce>         but soon gives you the attention your visit merits.
