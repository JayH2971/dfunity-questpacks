<ce>              %pct, we grow increasingly concerned about
<ce>             the threats being made against you. You must
<ce>            understand that an organization as prestigious
<ce>             as the Mages Guild, and wielding such power,
<ce>             attracts all manner of nefarious attention.
<ce>               Will you not hear me? Some of the rumors
<ce>                     truly speak to grave danger.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              That is truly dreadful, but I cannot force
<ce>             my will upon one whose rank exceeds my own.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>              Thank you! At least hear me, my good %pcf.
<ce>          I do not know your upbringing or past experiences
<ce>         prior to joining the guild, but you must understand
<ce>         the attention your actions have garnered. We hear of
<ce>         abductions, interrogations, mind control, and every
<ce>          kind of horrid fairy tale turned perverse against
<ce>              our highest members. Please, be cautious!
<ce>           I do not know what the coming days portend, but
<ce>             my sincerest desire is that all these things
<ce>            are as vapor, never to materialize. We will do
<ce>             our best to watch for you while you tarry in
<ce>              ___qgiver_, but I entreat you to exercise
<ce>              caution when outside these halls. Be safe.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>         My word! What has become of you? Please, tell me the
<ce>       whole matter. There is nothing more important than this.
<ce>
<ce>             By %god. These threats were indeed credible,
<ce>            and to think they would stalk about ___qgiver_
<ce>           to take you captive is the stuff of nightmares.
<ce>            We here at the guild hall are elated for your
<ce>              return. Nevertheless, I have one worrying
<ce>            detail to relate. You said the foe behind the
<ce>          arcane mechanism was named Jhuldarn, did you not?
<ce>            My dear %pcf, that was not him, I assure you.
<ce>        The lich Jhuldarn possesses power superior to that of
<ce>         fifty of the best living magicians in the Iliac Bay.
<ce>           No, this was merely a lich taking on Jhuldarn's
<ce>            name to inspire fear. I am troubled that such
<ce>             power has spread to the lichkind of Tamriel,
<ce>           but am truly happy that we, in fact, do not have
<ce>           the return of Jhuldarn on our hands. That would
<ce>             be the upheaval of all %crn. That is a fact.

Message:  1010
<ce>        No sooner than you have stepped out of the guild hall,
<ce>        two robed figures approach you from the side and grab
<ce>           hold of you. You are unable to react before they
<ce>         press some sort of enchanted object against the back
<ce>                of your neck. Everything turns black.

Message:  1011
<ce>          Now surrounded by darkness, you hear a voice boom
<ce>                        throughout the depths.
<ce>
<ce>               "Welcome, %pcn. Forgive my urging myself
<ce>             upon your itinerary. I wish to see what the
<ce>                Mages Guild has to offer these days."

Message:  1012
<ce>               A lich comes into view, scowling at you.
<ce>                      The booming voice returns.
<ce>
<ce>       "I wish to see what mettle your kind can throw at mine.
<ce>        See my loyal servant. He and his ilk will appear once
<ce>            per hour so long as you remain in the depths."

Message:  1013
<ce>             "What will you do, %pct of the Mages Guild?
<ce>           Will you run? You will fail. I have sealed this
<ce>            labyrinth mine. Find and duel me, or perish in
<ce>                         the depths forever."

Message:  1014
<ce>               "Suffer! Suffer! Is such a weakling made
<ce>                to rule over the Council of Archmages?
<ce>                      Or what is your ambition?"

Message:  1015
<ce>          "Know that I, Jhuldarn, will not be disappointed.
<ce>               You will prove the worth of that guild I
<ce>            sustained with my own hands, or show that I am
<ce>                now superior to it all. One outcome or
<ce>                    the other suits my purposes."

Message:  1016
<ce>                You hear nothing more than a chuckle.
<ce>              It appears you will have no means to leave
<ce>            except through this foe that has captured you.

Message:  1017
<ce>          "Now we shall duel. And what will you do with that
<ce>           ragged frame of yours? You are worn to the bone.
<ce>              Just like me. But I tire not. Come, %pct.
<ce>               Show me what the Mages Guild produces."

Message:  1018
<ce>                    Having fallen, Jhuldarn grins.
<ce>
<ce>                     "It is so. I am satisfied."
<ce>
<ce>                         All else is silent.

Message:  1019
<ce>               It appears you are incapable of leaving.
<ce>              You will have to find your foe to escape.

Message:  1028
<ce>            Your Recall spell does not work as it should.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ has warned me
 concerning ominous plots against my
 life made by various factions.
 He has insisted that I exercise
 caution when I go out.

Message:  1031

 I have been captured by an unknown enemy
