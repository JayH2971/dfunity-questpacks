<ce>                  %pcf, I must speak in a low voice
<ce>              regarding this matter. I do not doubt you
<ce>                have seen and destroyed your share of
<ce>           liches in the Iliac Bay. They are usually not a
<ce>            foe to be deeply feared. Well, this day we do
<ce>                have a foe to fear. We need someone to
<ce>              find a lich who has begun to make various
<ce>                      undead appear across %crn,
<ce>              ask what precisely the motivation for all
<ce>              this racket is, and see if any solution is
<ce>                forthcoming. We ask you specifically,
<ce>                    %pct. Will you do this for us?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                         Then we are doomed.
<ce>                      If you will not, who will?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Go quickly to ___mondung_. The sorceror has
<ce>            spoken to some who trespass what it considers
<ce>          its lair. Its demands, desires, plans, anything at
<ce>             all that you can bring out of it will be of
<ce>              inestimable worth at this point. Who knows
<ce>             whether it doesn't want to bring down all of
<ce>             %crn into a flaming ruin. We must hear from
<ce>               you in =timer_ days or fewer. And %pcf,
<ce>            please be prepared to run if things go wrong.

<ce>                  %oth. You are alive, miraculously.
<ce>                  Such overwhelming power! Jhuldarn
<ce>              is a name I have only read of, but whether
<ce>               it was in guild membership records or in
<ce>              fables of ages past, I cannot remember at
<ce>           this time. We will send you a letter in several
<ce>               weeks' time should we determine a course
<ce>              for future action. In the meantime, please
<ce>                 take this reward. The %t donated it
<ce>                  specifically for this task, to go
<ce>                      directly into your hands.

Message:  1020
<ce>                 A voice booms from deep within this
<ce>              place. You can't tell from what direction.
<ce>
<ce>                  "And what will you require of me,
<ce>                  %ra? Will I not slay you as I did
<ce>                the imperial mutton who preceded you?"
<ce>
<ce>              All goes quiet. Now to find the sorceror.

Message:  1021
<ce>                  "How utterly pathetic. %ra, I will
<ce>                say this now. Your attempts to stop me
<ce>              will be in vain. Even if you could topple
<ce>             me, within moments I will return to unlife.
<ce>                 Cease from this foolish errand. Tell
<ce>                    the Mages Guild that Jhuldarn
<ce>                has come to take what belongs to %g2.
<ce>                     Then bow down and take death
<ce>                       to be your new master."
<ce>
<ce>                 The lich begins chanting. The words
<ce>                  accelerate in intensity and speed.
<ce>                     This is the moment to leave.

Message:  1022
<ce>                   "What audacity. But here I am."
<ce>
<ce>                The lich rises to life once more in a
<ce>                new shell. Escape is your only option.

Message:  1023
<ce>                 You fight to catch your breath after
<ce>                racing out of the hole. It appears the
<ce>                  undead will remain inside for now.
<ce>                 After that taste of power, you will
<ce>                 have plenty to tell the Mages Guild.

Message:  1026
<ce>                   "What audacity. But here I am."
<ce>
<ce>                The lich rises to life once more in a
<ce>                new shell. Escape is your only option.

Message:  1027
<ce>                             "Run. Now."
<ce>
<ce>                The lich rises to life once more in a
<ce>                new shell. Escape is your only option.

Message:  1028
<ce>           The lich's incantation has perverted this place.
<ce>            Your Recall spell does not work as it should.

Message:  1029
<ce>              The environment roars with magical power.
<ce>                  There seems to be no end to this.
<ce>             If you were absolutely certain of yourself,
<ce>              you could try to interfere with the lich's
<ce>                       summoning spell. Do you?
<ce>
<ce>               (SKILL CHECK: YES: Mysticism, difficulty very high)

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 The Mages Guild has sent me on
 some apparently desperate mission
 to ___mondung_ for a
 lich who has taken up residence there.
 I am not tasked with slaying it, but
 with interrogating it regarding
 its purposes within %crn.
 I must return to ___questgiver_
 within =timer_ days.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 This lich has the power to bring
 revive itself endlessly. I must
 return to ___questgiver_
 and escape this menace for now.

Message:  1032
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>             You stop for a moment and channel everything
<ce>           you have within. It seems like it takes forever,
<ce>               though mere seconds have likely passed.
<ce>             Knowing of the rapidly advancing danger, you
<ce>            concentrate all the power you have and manage
<ce>          to perceive the spell's origin. Then you cut deep
<ce>                               into it.
<ce>
<ce>                "NO!" You hear the lich's voice boom.
<ce>                "My power... I will submit to NO ONE!"
<ce>
<ce>             What you've achieved is probably temporary,
<ce>               but it's enough to slow the creation of
<ce>                         the summoner's pets.

Message:  1033
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>            You stop for a moment and try to tap into the
<ce>      tremendous power that reverberates through these tunnels.
<ce>           You're quickly overwhelmed, and feel stupefied.
<ce>                       The lich's voice booms,
<ce>
<ce>             "HA HA HA! Such impudence! I feel insulted!
<ce>          If you admire my power so, have some more of it!"
<ce>
<ce>                The surge around you intensifies, and
<ce>            you notice more undead get added to the fray.
<ce>           You suffer a shock of magical feedback as well.
