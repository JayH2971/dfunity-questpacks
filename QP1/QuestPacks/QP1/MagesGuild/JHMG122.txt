QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>         We have a most unusual request from the %t.
<ce>  A truly immortal being, a criminal of a most suspect class,
<ce>  has taken up residence in a cave in %crn.
<ce>  The Fighters Guild, the City Watch, mercenaries,
<ce>  and all others have failed to kill this foe.
<ce>  They turn to us in their desperation,
<ce>  offering ten thousand gold coins
<ce>  for the successful dispatching of this foe.
<ce>  Creativity and tenacity must be yours
<ce>  if you intend to claim this prize, %pct.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>      I wonder who will ever stop this scourge upon Tamriel.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>        I wouldn't believe the reports of immortality,
<ce>  save for the abundance of eyewitness testimony to the effect.
<ce>  Where these powers came from, I cannot say, but this is
<ce>  an enemy of a most unique class. Look for a steel-clad warrior
<ce>  in ___mondung_. With any luck, your foe will be the only sapient
<ce>  being in the hole. Rather easy to find, I suppose.
<ce>  "Korilus" is the monicker this foe has taken on, so perhaps
<ce>  you'll get some response to that name.
<ce>  Kill this immortal fighter and return here
<ce>  within =timer_ days, and the gold shall be yours.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  You were to report on Korilus' death by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  A couple of burly servants of the %t approach you
<ce>  and give respectful nods. After hurling two large bags of gold
<ce>  at your feet, they depart without a word.

RumorsPostSuccess:   [1007]
The legendary warrior Korilus was slain. I can scarcely believe it!
<--->
Korilus has been sent to Aetherius.  What next, will gods die?
<--->
Korilus' reign of terror has ended!

Message:  1010
<ce>      Somewhere in this cave is the lair of Korilus,
<ce>  the so-called immortal warrior.

Message:  1011
<ce>      This foe has the appearance of a normal warrior,
<ce>  but something else is afoot. You feel immense power
<ce>  radiating out toward you, as if to knock you over.
<ce>  Your foe's eyes betray no mercy. The battle commences.

Message:  1012
<ce>       "I... die?"
<ce>  
<ce>  Korilus can scarcely believe what is happening.
<ce>  But all of a sudden, it is over. All life is gone.
<ce>  You have a reward to claim, and fame to boot.

Message:  1013
<ce>     Oh, this is a tale not to be forgotten.
<ce>  No hack-and-slash barbarian is capable of doing what
<ce>  you have now accomplished! I'll send a missive
<ce>  requesting your reward. They didn't seriously think
<ce>  you would be able to accomplish it, so they don't
<ce>  have the money available yet. Just wait around
<ce>  ___questgiver_ for a day or so, and it should
<ce>  arrive, I expect.
<ce>  
<ce>  What a story, %pcf!

%qdt:
 The Mages Guild of ___questgiver_ has sent me to find
 some way to slay an "immortal" warrior
 named Korilus, who resides in ___mondung_.
 If I can do so and return within =timer_ days,
 I am to be rewarded ten thousand gold coins.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 No one actually believed I could kill Korilus,
 so my reward is not yet ready. I should stay
 around ___questgiver_ until I am paid.
