QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>   One of our fellow mages has been sent to collect
<ce>   the dues from the people of ___tavern_.
<ce>   Unfortunately, he has not yet returned
<ce>   and it is believed that some vile creature
<ce>   or another has gotten the better of him.
<ce>   It is most embarrassing for us, but worse yet,
<ce>   he is carrying all our dues with him.
<ce>   Would you be willing to search the town for him
<ce>   and retrieve the funds?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>         Magic is important, but so is money, %pct.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>           Very good. In ___tavern_, _scholar_ was
<ce>     planning to stay in _tavern_. This should have been
<ce>     a routine collection visit but he has taken far too
<ce>     long to return, and sent no information regarding
<ce>     the delay. Please travel there and ensure that
<ce>     he is forthcoming. And alive, if you please.
<ce>     Be here in =timer_ days for =reward_ gold pieces.
<ce>     You will be searching for a =scholar_.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>     The time to report on ___tavern_'s
<ce>     missing funds has passed.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            Hmph. _scholar_ is merely a Journeyman,
<ce>     and is likely to remain so for some time.
<ce>     We keep records of who does their work properly,
<ce>     and we rarely forget such carelessness.
<ce>     Make a note of that, %pcf. But the matter
<ce>     is resolved, and you get full credit.

Message:  1010
<ce>        "_scholar_? Nope, no one here by that name.
<ce>     Nuh-uh. Might wanna head back to your mages and
<ce>     tell 'em that. I know all these people and
<ce>     _scholar_ ain't one of 'em."
<ce>     
<ce>     A bit of charming magic might reveal something
<ce>     more here. Do you make an attempt at rearranging
<ce>     this patron's mind? If you are caught, the
<ce>     consequence could be serious.
<ce>
<ce>           (SKILL CHECK: YES: Thaumaturgy, difficulty low)

Message:  1011
<ce>                       (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>      This person's eyes close slowly as you quietly cast a spell.
<ce>      When they open again, you see a very different demeanor.
<ce>      
<ce>      "You know what? I need some more alcohol.
<ce>      Been a long day. Sorry for the way I've been
<ce>      treating you. _scholar_ has been in and out of
<ce>      here all day. Said the last few dues have been resistant
<ce>      but didn't want to tell them mages until it was all
<ce>      together. Wait here for a few minutes and you'll see him."

Message:  1012
<ce>                       (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>      You attempt a charming effect, but this patron
<ce>      resists it. Angry shouting ensues.
<ce>      
<ce>      "GUARDS! This %ra's tryin' ta hypnotize me!
<ce>      An evil person this one is! Someone help!"
<ce>      
<ce>      A hasty escape ensues, and the city watch
<ce>      are on their way.

Message:  1013
<ce>      With no apparent help within the tavern, 
<ce>      the best you can do is remain here in ___tavern_
<ce>      and search. Surely something will come up
<ce>      to send you in the right direction.

Message:  1014
<ce>      You are approached by a =scholar_ with a rather
<ce>      displeased expression.
<ce>      
<ce>      "They sent someone to check on me! Those moronic cads!
<ce>      I almost have the money put together, and now they
<ce>      waste your time as well!"
<ce>      
<ce>      _scholar_ frowns and shows you a fairly large bag containing gold.
<ce>      
<ce>      "I have a Recall spell ready and I'll be at ___qgiver_
<ce>      when I have the last one collected. I might even
<ce>      be there sooner than you. Tell them to get off my back
<ce>      and be more grateful for doing their legwork."
<ce>      
<ce>      Without a goodbye, he then leaves to finish the task.

Message:  1015
<ce>        What are you doing here?
<ce>     The mage carrying those funds is staying
<ce>     in ___tavern_!

Message:  1016
<ce>     This patron then leaves,
<ce>     looking for someone more pleasant to talk to.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 Someone named _scholar_ has gone to ___tavern_
 to gather guild dues, but has not returned on time
 or sent any information regarding the task.
 I am to travel there, look in _tavern_, and
 ensure the funds arrive in ___qgiver_
 within =timer_ days. I'm looking for a =scholar_.
 My reward will be =reward_ gold pieces.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 I have made contact with _scholar_ and was promised
 that the funds will arrive in ___qgiver_ soon.

Message:  1032
%qdt:
 I didn't find _scholar_ in the tavern.
 I'll have to find some way to locate
 him within the town.
