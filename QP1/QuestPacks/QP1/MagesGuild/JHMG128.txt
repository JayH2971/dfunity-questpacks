QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> The Order of the Black Worm has stirred from their
<ce> underground lair and brought their necromantic
<ce> rituals to the surface. They're raising ancient dead
<ce> and have begun terrorizing the land. The Mages Guild
<ce> has taken note of their resurgence as a threat, and
<ce> we've determined that taking out their leader will
<ce> slow them down enough to allow the Order to be
<ce> defeated. The leader of the Order is based out of
<ce> an ancient crypt, so could you please
<ce> track him down and destroy him?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  (sigh) I suppose I'll have to wait for the brave ones to arrive.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>   Stellar, %pct! Now, I said "him" but I really have no idea.
<ce>   We have no information about the identity of said worm leader.
<ce>   In fact, calling them an order is rather excessive.
<ce>   But nonetheless, you are to enter into ___dungeon_
<ce>   and seek out the nightblade in there. It's useful to dispose
<ce>   of other mages, but they yet learn from their leader.
<ce>   Cut off the head and the body will perish!
<ce>   You have =timer_ days to return here for =reward_ gold pieces.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>     _qgiver_ expected you to destroy the leader
<ce>     of the Order of the Black Worm by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>     I wager you had quite an adventure down there!
<ce>     Thrilling memories to treasure up, when
<ce>     one day you'll be old, decrepit, and writing books
<ce>     on alchemy for a living. Ah, how depressing.
<ce>     We're not there yet, %pct! Instead, enjoy
<ce>     your reward.

<ce>    The magical attunement here is obvious. It hits you like
<ce>    a wall once you enter, and seems to be thick throughout
<ce>    the environment. A skilled mage could turn the enchantment
<ce>    to your benefit, but it would take some time and
<ce>    provoke additional danger if you fail.
<ce>    
<ce>    Do you attempt to make the Order's minions your own?

<ce>           (SKILL CHECK: YES: Mysticism, difficulty high)

<ce>                       (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>        
<ce>        It takes a bit of time and drains you. However, you're
<ce>        more skilled than the Order's leader. You reverse the flow
<ce>        of magicka, turning it in your favor.
<ce>        
<ce>        Many of the undead minions here will now obey you.

Message:  1012
<ce>                       (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>        
<ce>        It takes a bit of time and drains you. However, your efforts
<ce>        only strengthen the flow of magicka, and the power that resurrects
<ce>        the undead minions grows stronger. Using the magic flow as a bridge,
<ce>        you hear laughter from the Order's leader.
<ce>        
<ce>        "Well done, imbecile! I don't mind having more control!"

Message:  1013
<ce>         "No, you won't stop me now! Not you, not anyone!"
<ce>      The Order's leader snarls at you.

Message:  1014
<ce>      With the leader dead, the minions stop rising.
<ce>      This group will lose all power soon.

Message:  1015
<ce>  You choose to traverse ___dungeon_ on its own terms.
<ce>  Who knows what kinds of problems could come from
<ce>  interfering with this spell.

Message:  1016
<ce>   One of the shambling undead approaches you.
<ce>  It makes an awkward bowing motion and howls,
<ce>  "The Order... will pay!"
