<ce>         Something to do? Oh! Oh my, yes, it's kind of a trivial
<ce>         matter, but I will record it in the guild register
<ce>         nonetheless if you will lend a helping hand.
<ce>         This object, this silly little book here, must be
<ce>         returned to _house_ off to the %di
<ce>         in a most expeditious manner.
<ce>         As in, ehm, the next two hours. Have you a good
<ce>         pair of walking legs, %pct?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>         Oh dear. I don't want to go all the way over there myself.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>         Ah, delightful! A most sporting answer. Yes, you will rise
<ce>         far and quickly, most certainly, I can easily predict!
<ce>         Well then, have this book. _book_ is the title.
<ce>         I, erm, have held on to it for too long and must
<ce>         now divest myself of it before my good friend
<ce>         returns home in a few hours' time.
<ce>         I don't care where you leave it, so long as the book
<ce>         is inside _house_. A safe return to you!

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>         You were to report on the book's return to _house_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>         Monsters?! %oth, that is worrying indeed!
<ce>         Did you-- I apologize, I was about to ask if you survived,
<ce>         but... I'm sorry, this brain of mine is not quite so agile.
<ce>         I sincerely hope the town guard or someone will have
<ce>         disposed of what you could not. Please keep this matter
<ce>         "under wraps," as the trending speech goes. Yes? Please?

Ah, a fine day to you %pct!

 _qgiver_ of ___qgiver_ has given me
 a book, _book_, that needs to be put inside
 _house_ of ___house_.
 I have but two hours to report back to __qgiver_.

Message:  1011
<ce>  Something is afoot within _house_.
<ce>  You hear the noise of something feral and dangerous,
<ce>  and it appears to be loose.

Message:  1012
<ce>      You place the book inside the residence.
<ce>      Now it's time to return to __qgiver_.

Message:  1013
<ce>      You escape _house_ and hear
<ce>      something else nearby. It appears your entry into the
<ce>      house stirred up a second creature,
<ce>      and it begins to defend its territory.

Message:  1014
<ce>  Yes? _house_ is off that way, %di.
<ce>  Please deliver the book within two hours' time.
