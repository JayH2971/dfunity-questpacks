QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                      %pct, %crn grants us great
<ce>                  autonomy concerning our methods of
<ce>               research, our purposes, our disciplinary
<ce>             pursuits, and so forth, provided we promote
<ce>              the "common good" with our scholarly work.
<ce>              A fascinating term, that. In exchange, we
<ce>               have something of an unspoken agreement,
<ce>            if you will, that when students of the magical
<ce>               arts become a menace to society, we are
<ce>             the first to remove the threat. Please help
<ce>                 us to fulfill that agreement, %pcf.
                                     <--->
<ce>            Great scandals surround the Mages Guild, many
<ce>             of which are started by those envious of the
<ce>          power we wield. To ensure a spark does not become
<ce>             a wildfire, we must stamp out any cause for
<ce>             suspicion with haste. A knave in fellowship
<ce>              with this honorable institution has taken
<ce>            advantage of our good name to conduct work of
<ce>             the foulest kind, putting us all in jeopardy
<ce>                of disrepute. Will you dispose of this
<ce>               renegade and help us maintain our image?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             I assure you, %pct, had you permitted me to
<ce>              explain more, you would not have refused.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               A worthy response. This duty falls upon
<ce>              every member of the guild in its due time.
<ce>                     We will send you to ___res_.
<ce>                  A guild member in the city, highly
<ce>                   trustworthy, informs us that the
<ce>                    errant magician, _necr_, hides
<ce>                       and practices in _res_.
<ce>                 I certainly hope necromancy inspires
<ce>                 no fear in you, for that is what you
<ce>                    have agreed to quash this day.
<ce>                  Make this rogue magician one with
<ce>                  the death that so fascinates %g2.
<ce>               We must know it is done in =timer_ days.
<ce>                        Courage, good friend.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                 The Mages Guild has waited for your
<ce>                   announcement of _necr_'s death,
<ce>                     and the time has now passed.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                   Splendidly done, %pct. This work
<ce>                 ensures the general public lends the
<ce>                proper confidence to the Mages Guild.
<ce>                  Would a _diam_ be a proper reward
<ce>                  for this task, in your estimation?
<ce>                    I pray you put it to good use.

<ce>                  (SKILL CHECK PASSED: DESTRUCTION)
<ce>
<ce>                  The necromancer activates a trap,
<ce>                sending a bolt of magic flying at you.
<ce>           Your quick reflexes and knowledge of Destruction
<ce>        magic allow you to halt the bolt in midair and return
<ce>               it to its caster. "OW!" your foe winces.

<ce>                  (SKILL CHECK FAILED: DESTRUCTION)
<ce>
<ce>                  The necromancer activates a trap,
<ce>                sending a bolt of magic flying at you.
<ce>              Someone more skilled in Destruction magic
<ce>            might have avoided it one way or another, but
<ce>                      you suffer injury instead.

Message:  1020
<ce>                  "How pathetic. Why will you fools
<ce>                   continue to resist the power and
<ce>                   beauty of the art of necromancy?
<ce>                   Do you not see the hypocrisy in
<ce>                  slaying me? But if you so insist,
<ce>                 we will have our duel. Have at you."

Message:  1022
<ce>                 The necromancer falls to the ground.
<ce>                       Your duty is fulfilled.
