<ce>                  You request the immediate payment.
<ce>                In addition to a hefty sack of money,
<ce>              you have earned the villagers' admiration.
<ce>             You expect you'll be spoken well of in %crn
<ce>                         for quite some time.

Message:  1010
<ce>   As you enter ___tavern_, you see a piece of brittle posterboard.
<ce>                It has an advertisement of some kind.
<ce>
<ce>       "WANTED: Hunter for ravenous werewolf. Has been stealing
<ce>            local herdlife in the night time. Gold reward.
<ce>               Find _aldman_ at _tavern_ if interested.
<ce>     If no takers in 3 days, will seek mercenary in other town."
<ce>
<ce>                You note down the information, in case
<ce>                 you decide to take up their request.

Message:  1011
%qdt:
 The people of ___tavern_ are suffering loss
 of livestock at the hands of a werewolf.
 I can speak to _aldman_ at _tavern_
 to offer my help within the next =entry_ days,
 should I so desire.

Message:  1012
<ce>         _aldman_ seems lost in thought and quite anguished.
<ce>          Your approach is scarcely noticed until you speak.
<ce>
<ce>      "Oh! Hi. Hi, yes, I'm the one you want to talk to, right?
<ce>      About the werewolf? Well, I'm glad someone's taken it up.
<ce>            Town guard are useless about this, as always.
<ce>  They don't patrol at night, which is when the werewolf comes out.
<ce>  Kind of pointless if you ask me. We're suffering significant loss
<ce>    of animals of all kinds, all livestock: cows, sheep, chicken,
<ce>     you name it. We keep asking the local enforcer, _enforcer_,
<ce>  for some help tracking it down, but all we see are dragging feet.
<ce>                   Makes me wonder why I pay taxes.
<ce>
<ce>          "If you can find and kill this werewolf that keeps
<ce>      attacking ___tavern_, our gratitude would know no bounds.
<ce>      And of course there would be gold in it for you, enough to
<ce>               compensate your travels, I assure you."

Message:  1013
_enforcer_ tends to spend time in _tavern2_.
<--->
_enforcer_'s the enforcer in ___tavern_. Very good fellow. Hangs out in _tavern2_.

Message:  1014
%qdt:
 _aldman_ of ___tavern_ told me that the town guard
 are of no help disposing of the werewolf that hunts
 animals inside the city. All the killings happen at night,
 when the town guard do not patrol. _enforcer_
 is the local enforcer for the town, and could be useful.

Message:  1015
<ce>       _enforcer_ lazily looks at you while sipping from a mug.
<ce>       His expression of relaxation and ease seems contagious.
<ce>
<ce>    "Let me guess. You wanna talk about the werewolf, am I right?
<ce>     Of course. I keep this forsaken city safe from every single
<ce>     danger on Tamriel, but when a single werewolf starts feeding
<ce> on farm animals, the sky starts falling. Yes, I know about the problem.
<ce>         No, I don't have a solution to it. The %t refuses to
<ce>        send our watchmen weaponry that can kill lycanthropes,
<ce>      so unless you want us to pound it with clubs or something,
<ce>               I don't foresee us doing much about it.
<ce>
<ce>   "Listen, you can still get your reward. Make a good faith effort
<ce> to get to the bottom of this, and maybe they'll pay you. I'll help you out.
<ce>            Go talk to _farmer_, one of the local farmers;
<ce>       %g1 just reported another lost animal to me last night.
<ce>   Go talk to %g2 and see what %g1 has to say. That's the best lead
<ce>    I can give you... unless you want to go out at night and hunt
<ce>         the beast yourself, and if you do, all power to you.
<ce>            But I'm honestly beyond caring at this point.
<ce>        If someone wants to get rid of this lupe, they should
<ce>          start financing our town guard better, not whining
<ce>                   about problems on posterboards."

Message:  1016
%qdt:
_enforcer_, the enforcer for ___tavern_,
told me that the town guard are too poorly
equipped to handle a werewolf due to
the %t's negligence. He suggested that I could still claim
my reward from _aldman_,
even if I fail to eliminate the beast,  with some due diligence
into the matter. I can talk to _farmer_
about a recent animal that %g1 lost, to start.

Message:  1017
<ce>           _farmer_ stares at you with hollow, baggy eyes.
<ce>    You can't imagine %g1 has slept in a week, from how %g1 looks.
<ce>
<ce> "Hi. You're investigating the werewolf? Glad someone's doing something,
<ce> unlike that useless enforcer. I've heard of people killing dozens of
<ce> werewolves before. I don't think there's anything special about this
<ce>         one, other than being really smart and really quiet.
<ce>    I was outside last night, trying to watch for it, but somehow
<ce>   it snuck past me and tore my cow to shreds with hardly a sound.
<ce>           The filthy thing must be getting fat off of us,
<ce>             incompetent as we are at defending the town.
<ce>
<ce> "If you're serious about killing this thing, you should know something.
<ce>   There's an apothecary over in ___apoc_ who's had some experience
<ce>        with weres before. If you can get over there, look for
<ce>       _merch_ in _apoc_. Last letter I got from %g2 said that
<ce> there are certain tricks you can use to uncover the wolf's identity.
<ce>         Told me that it'd cost 1260 gold to make it happen.
<ce> I regret not paying it sooner, because I'm down to my last cow now.
<ce>     Don't know how I'll make ends meet if that one's killed too.
<ce>    If you head over there and pay _merch_, you'll get compensated
<ce>       for it, I promise. We need help. Please, do something."

Message:  1018
%qdt:
_farmer_, a farmer who lost a cow to the werewolf,
told me about an alchemist named _merch_
who stays at _apoc_ in ___apoc_,
having some kind of special trick to lure out
the beast. It'll cost 1260 gold, but
the villagers assure me my pay will be worth it.

Message:  1019
<ce>     You approach _merch_ and say you come on behalf of _farmer_.
<ce>
<ce>        "Ahh, yes! The problem with the wolfie, yes. You have
<ce>              the money, yes? Gold first, chat second."
<ce>
<ce>        You produce the necessary money. _merch_ counts it out
<ce>                  and shows a rather repulsive grin.
<ce>
<ce>   "Good, good. Let's talk werewolves. As you know, lycan-anythings
<ce>           are normal people with a bit of a curse on them.
<ce>       Most wish they could do away with it. Some have accepted
<ce>          their new life, and carve out a place in life with
<ce>      their newfound abilities, so to speak, yes. It's rare that
<ce>     one wolf would stay in the same settlement for so long, yes,
<ce>          but if it meets no resistance, it would make sense
<ce>         to take advantage of a weakened prey, would it not?
<ce>
<ce>      "Yes, yes, I am able to help you find this werewolf. Well,
<ce>          I will be able to. The gold you just paid me will
<ce>    cover the cost of all ingredients for my cocktail except one,
<ce>       and that, because you cannot buy it! There's a supply of
<ce>     snake venom in ___dungeon_ that is of exquisite quality, yes,
<ce>               very necessary for the effect you seek.
<ce>             I cannot go for it myself due to commitments
<ce>       I must fulfill, but if you bring it, I shall create the
<ce>            mixture you seek to bring out the inner beast.
<ce>      Now go then, yes, before more cows and sheep are killed!"

Message:  1020
<ce>        This snake venom shines brilliantly in the dim light.
<ce>                 If _merch_ wanted a special variety,
<ce>                         you hope this is it.

Message:  1021
<ce>      _merch_'s eyes light up once you produce the snake venom.
<ce>
<ce>      "Yes! Very good, very good! Yes, this is it. You're lucky
<ce>           you only had to procure it yourself, my chosen!
<ce>    Had you paid for it, the cost would exceed four figures, yes!
<ce>         In your absence I gathered the other ingredients and
<ce>         prepared the mix. Now watch a master at work, yes!"
<ce>
<ce>         You give %g2 space to work. _merch_ furiously begins
<ce>             beating, smoothing, humidifying, and drying
<ce>        a series of exotic ingredients, some of which are kept
<ce>       from your view. The greedy merchant must want to protect
<ce>         %g3 trade secrets. The process doesn't take long but
<ce>                          is very intricate.
<ce>
<ce>    "Hah! Huzzah, there it is! We have it, we have it indeed, yes!
<ce>          When you return to ___tavern_, place this mixture
<ce>        on your hands and bring them close to a person's face.
<ce>       If that person is a werewolf in disguise, you will know!
<ce>                You will find out quite quickly, yes!
<ce>      A thousand good suns to you and your people of ___tavern_,
<ce>                       my good customer! Yes!"
<ce>
<ce>                You are given a dry, clay-like mixture
<ce>                with a tag that says "Werewolf blood."
<ce>     It clearly isn't blood, but that's the name _merch_ gave it.
<ce>
<ce>                 Before waving you off, %g1 mentions,
<ce>    "By the way, if you're a were-whatever, it won't work on you.
<ce>        You've been breathing in an antidote while you waited.
<ce>           So if that's your secret, keep it to yourself."

Message:  1022
<ce>           You rub the "werewolf blood" across your hands.
<ce>           The scent is quite strong, even from a distance.

Message:  1023
<ce>           You wave your hands in front of _aldman_'s face.
<ce>                You are quite skilled at annoying %g2.
<ce>
<ce>              "Is there something wrong with you, %ra?"

Message:  1024
<ce>           You wave your hands in front of _farmer_'s face,
<ce>                and get nothing but disgust in return.
<ce>
<ce>                 "That smell makes me want to vomit.
<ce>                What in %god's name is wrong with you?
<ce>           Go find that werewolf and stop messing around."

Message:  1025
<ce>              _enforcer_ begins to shudder and tremble.
<ce>                          "Hurk-HURKKKKK!!"
<ce>       He breathes erratically, trying hard to keep composure.

Message:  1026
<ce>       You scarcely need to extend your hands toward _enforcer_
<ce>           before a violent reaction starts to take place.
<ce>             His eyes bulge, and his muscles flex wildly.
<ce>         Unable to resist the smell, he finds himself forced
<ce>           into a transformation -- into his werewolf form.
<ce>         He howls into the sky, burning with shame and fury.
<ce>
<ce>  As you ready for battle, you hear a voice coming from behind you.
<ce>               A woman is trying to get your attention.
<ce>
<ce>          "No! No, please, for %god's life, don't kill him!
<ce>     He's my husband! I-I didn't know! We'll move away from here,
<ce>        we'll start a new life in the Imperial City, anything!
<ce>                 Just please don't kill my husband!"
<ce>
<ce>           _enforcer_ restrains himself long enough for you
<ce>            to make a decision. Will you attack him (YES)
<ce>                or let him escape with his wife (NO)?

Message:  1027
<ce>       The woman cries out in anguish and leaves the building.
<ce>        _enforcer_ gives in to his base instincts and attacks.

Message:  1028
<ce>    You step aside and let _enforcer_ go. Before he loses control
<ce>      of himself, he rushes outside, and his wife follows after.
<ce>             You are left without even a word of thanks.
<ce>
<ce>       Meanwhile, _aldman_ enters the tavern, attracted by the
<ce>         cries of the tavern folk. You need not tell %g3 that
<ce>        the werewolf yet lives; %g1 is well aware of the fact.
<ce>
<ce>      "You rid us of our wolf, yes, but not much more than that.
<ce>          We wanted him dead -- we wanted vengeance, proof.
<ce>          Perhaps someone else will suffer for what you have
<ce>                        failed to do this day.
<ce>
<ce>       "We'll work with the %t about procuring better weaponry
<ce>        for the city watch. That way, we won't have to rely on
<ce>                 unsteady mercenaries in the future."
<ce>
<ce>               _aldman_ gives you =smallreward_ coins,
<ce>         enough to cover your expenses, and departs abruptly.

Message:  1029
<ce>         The whole tavern raises a cheer as _enforcer_ falls.
<ce>      You're considered quite a hero for taking on the werewolf
<ce>              without their aid. Soon, _aldman_ enters,
<ce>               having been informed by fleeing peasants
<ce>               that the werewolf was in this building.
<ce>
<ce>            "What a surprise! _enforcer_ was the werewolf?
<ce>              He had me and the entire town fooled, wow!
<ce>               You're worth a lot more than this money.
<ce>         Maybe we'll have to look for you again in the future
<ce>                   when things start going wrong."
<ce>
<ce>                _aldman_ then explains that there are
<ce>    two ways you can receive payment: a lump sum of approximately
<ce>       3,000 gold right now, or a perpetual weekly delivery of
<ce>          a couple hundred gold as long as their farms last.
<ce>               Do you take the immediate payment (YES)
<ce>                     or the passive income (NO)?

Message:  1030
<ce>                   You request the passive income.
<ce>             _aldman_ nods and says, "I can respect that.
<ce>           We'll try to keep tabs on you, wherever you are,
<ce>   and make sure it's delivered to whatever city you're staying at.
<ce>      That's the surest thing we can do to show our appreciation
<ce>              for saving our farms. Safe travels, %pcf."

Message:  1031
<ce>                   A seasoned courier atop a horse
<ce>            rides toward you with a letter and a package.
<ce>
<ce>                 "%pcf? Delivery for you. Farewell."
<ce>
<ce>             You open the letter and read the following.
<ce>
"Dear %pcn,
<ce>
  I cannot thank you enough for sparing my life.
 The opulence with which I lived in ___tavern_ clouded
 my view of things. With the help of my wife, I will
 soon have a cure for my lycanthropic curse. The gods
 have a special place in their hearts for the deliberately
 merciful, I am sure.
<ce>
  I managed to obtain an enchanted _magic_ recently,
 which I have no use for. I pray that your exceeding
 wisdom will find some good purpose for it.
<ce>
            Gratitude abounding,
            _enforcer_"

Message:  1032
<ce>             The telltale snarl of a werewolf approaches.
<ce>                        You are being hunted.

Message:  1033
<ce>          Upon suffering injury, the werewolf howls angrily
<ce>          and sprints away, jumping onto rooftops to escape.

Message:  1034
<ce>                  You flee from _tavern_. _enforcer_
<ce>         takes the opportunity to escape by a different way.
<ce>             The townspeople make an uproar, furious that
<ce>            you have lost the one opportunity they had to
<ce>                           dispose of him.

Message:  1035
<ce>     You approach _merch_ and say you come on behalf of _farmer_.
<ce>
<ce>        "Ahh, yes! The problem with the wolfie, yes. You have
<ce>              the money, yes? Gold first, chat second."
<ce>
<ce>         You search for the necessary money, but do not have
<ce>            the necessary coins. _merch_ shakes %g3 head.
<ce>
<ce>         "Bring me 1260 coins. Otherwise, I cannot help you."

Message:  1036
<ce>          Somewhere in here hides the snake venom you need.

Message:  1037
%qdt:
 The apothecary in ___apoc_ gave me a mixture
 called "Werewolf's Blood" that's designed to
 expose who the werewolf is. I should apply it to my hands,
 and then bring them close to anyone I suspect.

Message:  1038
%qdt:
The apothecary _merch_ in ___apoc_
told me to go to ___dungeon_
and find some special Snake Venom
required for the werewolf identification mixture.
