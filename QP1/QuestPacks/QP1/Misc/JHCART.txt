<ce>              You were given =timer_ days to start your
<ce>               work with the Cartographers and return.
<ce>                        That time has expired.

<ce>                 Good work! We occasionally send our
<ce>             members on such trips to calculate distances
<ce>               and so on. Cartography is a science that
<ce>                 must undergo continual development.
<ce>
<ce>               As I said, your early fees will be low.
<ce>             This time we only have _reward_ gold pieces
<ce>             allotted for you. But please be patient with
<ce>               us and let more funding come in. We hope
<ce>             you'll keep helping us. Who knows what could
<ce>            turn up in one of Tamriel's forgotten corners?
<ce>               So, we'll send for you when we need you.

  The Cartographers' Association of the Iliac Bay
  ____place_ Charter
 
  A group of expert explorers and designers wish to
  chart some of the locations lost to memory that might
  have historical or resourceful value to the public.
  We are currently accepting applicants for new explorers
  at ___place_ for the next =1st_ days. Present
  personally to _qg_ at _place_. In
  your service to Tamriel, you will travel leagues innumerable,
  see locations forgotten by time, and unearth secrets
  the Archaeologists have dreamt of for decades.
 
  The Cartographers' Association is supported by donations
  from generous citizens and by a commission of local wealth,
  as chartered by each regional monarch.

<ce>                  Welcome! My name is _qg_, and I am
<ce>            the regional registrar for the Cartographers'
<ce>            Association of the Iliac Bay. I assume that by
<ce>                coming here, you show some interest in
<ce>              uncovering the mysteries of Hammerfell and
<ce>            High Rock, are capable of long-distance travel
<ce>           on a coin's drop, and can handle yourself under
<ce>             adverse and sometimes dangerous conditions.
<ce>              Now that I have warned you concerning the
<ce>              hazards of the cartographer's path, do you
<ce>              desire to follow it and aid us in mapping
<ce>               out Tamriel's past, present, and future?

Message:  1013
<ce>                  Then I formally welcome you, %pcf,
<ce>           to the ranks of the Cartographers. Please allow
<ce>           me some short explanations. First, your actions
<ce>           will be your own while on duty. If you sleep on
<ce>              some street you're not supposed to or take
<ce>             something that doesn't really belong to you,
<ce>            you will be prosecuted and not us. The courts
<ce>             know this well and will not humor any excuse
<ce>            that involves naming us. Second, compensation
<ce>            is middling for a new recruit such as yourself
<ce>             and depends on the generosity of our donors.
<ce>            We hope to improve on it, but at the start you
<ce>            may only be earning your own travel expenses.
<ce>
<ce>          With that out of the way, allow me to present you
<ce>          your first assignment. This is indeed menial, but
<ce>           we must ascertain the skill level of each member
<ce>            by the work they do. Your first assignment is
<ce>                   to find  _target_ in ___target_,
<ce>         a simple test. I'll give you =timer_ days to do that
<ce>                           and return here.

Message:  1015
<ce>            Well, I hope you change your mind. You appear
<ce>             to be cut out for it, in my honest opinion.

Message:  1020
<ce>               From all you can tell, this is the place
<ce>                      _qg_ told you to find. Now
<ce>                 to report its location back to %g2.

%qdt:
 _qg_, registrar of the
 Cartographers, has given me an
 entry exam of sorts to look for
 _target_ in ___target_.
 I must find it, enter it, and return
 to ___place_ within =timer_ days.

Message:  1099
<ce>                      You will find _target_ in
<ce>                     ___target_. Enter it to make
<ce>             sure and return here. You have =timer_ days
<ce>                     to complete your entry exam.
