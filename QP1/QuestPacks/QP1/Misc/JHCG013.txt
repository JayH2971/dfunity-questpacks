<ce>              The Cartographers needed you to report on
<ce>            the location of the Glenmoril Witches by now.

<ce>              Welcome back. Pretty weird people, right?
<ce>               You're free to go back and see what they
<ce>               have to offer if you want. Just remember
<ce>              to keep me and the rest of the association
<ce>             out of it. If we find you drinking blood and
<ce>               dancing in a thunderstorm or something,
<ce>                 we're keeping our names far from it.

  %pcf,
 
  We wish to assign you to make a chart from the
  Glenmorial Coven in Ilessan Hills to my current location.
  You are granted =timer_ days from now. Please see
  me if you need directions on how to find it.

<ce>             Welcome, Scout. The route before you is not
<ce>          particularly easy. A friend told me you can reach
<ce>                   the Glenmorial Coven like this.
 
<ce>            First, mount a horse at Old Chrystausa's Place
<ce>              in Ilessan Hills. Get the horse pressed up
<ce>               against the house's west wall, and then
<ce>               ride for between eighty and eighty-five
<ce>              seconds directly to the west. After that,
<ce>            continue north until you see it. It looks like
<ce>             a brick dome with grass on top. If you find
<ce>                 yourself at the same latitude as The
<ce>                 Hearthhart Cemetery, you've gone too
<ce>             far to the north. It's east of Crossfort and
<ce>          north of Old Evelona's Place, if that's any help.
<ce>           I don't know if this is your first time meeting
<ce>          the witches, but if it is, make sure you've got a
<ce>            strong stomache before you do them any favors.

<ce>                   The dome before you must be the
<ce>                      Glenmoril Witches' coven.
<ce>                     You can report this to _qg_.
                                     <--->
<ce>                You can see the Glenmoril Witches. Now
<ce>                 You can head to ___place_ to report.

%qdt:
 _qg_ has sent me to
 find the coven of the
 Glenmoril Witches in
 Ilesan Hills. I have =timer_
 days to present my chart
 in ___place_.

%qdt:
 To find the Glenmorial Coven,
 I can mount a horse and head to
 Old Chrystausa's Place in Ilessan Hills.
 Starting beside the home, I can ride
 west for eighty to eighty-five seconds,
 and then go straight north. If I reach
 the same latitude as The Hearthhart
 Cemetery, I need to go further south.

Message:  1099
<ce>          Some people try to find the witches to curry favor
<ce>           with them. I stay out of such people's business.
<ce>             So much can go wrong when working with them.
