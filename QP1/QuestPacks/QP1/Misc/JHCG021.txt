<ce>            Not what you were expecting, right Pathfinder?
<ce>               We Cartographers make different maps for
<ce>            different purposes. The place we just sent you
<ce>             to won't be on ordinary maps, I can say that
<ce>             much. Take your pay, and see if anyone will
<ce>                    believe what you've witnessed.

<ce>             There's a letter in your pack which carries
<ce>                the compass seal of the Cartographers.

Message:  1011
  Pathfinder,
 
  We have a mission which will require you to scout
  a location I cannot name at this time. Please see
  me for directions on how to reach it. All I can say
  is that it is a tomb that carries great meaning for
  the people of High Rock. This assignment will
  last for =timer_ days.

<ce>               Pathfinder, well met. We are sending you
<ce>           to Menevia. Begin at the village of Westcastle.
<ce>           From the House of Dibella, walk straight south.
<ce>          Your destination will be visible after the second
<ce>         hill you cross. It's a small building made of brick
<ce>           with an odd-looking roof that stretches over it,
<ce>            like an awning. Venture inside if you wish for
<ce>            curiosity's sake, but I urge caution. We have
<ce>            lost enough people inside that cavern. I will
<ce>              hear from you before =timer_ days are up.

<ce>                  This must be the mysterious tomb.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 You see the tomb before you. Now to
<ce>                           return to _qg_.

 The Cartographers have sent me
 to scout a nameless tomb. I
 should speak to _qg_ at
 ___place_ in ____place_
 for directions on where it is.
 I have =timer_ days to see it
 and return.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 The Cartographers instructed me
 on how to find the tomb. I should
 start in the village of Westcastle in
 Menevia. Beginning at the House of
 Dibella, I should walk south across two
 hills. The tomb should be in front of me
 then, a small brick building.

Message:  1099
<ce>               The place should be pretty easy to find.
<ce>            I don't know that it's more than a few hundred
<ce>              steps out. Follow the directions and come
<ce>                   back here when you've found it.
