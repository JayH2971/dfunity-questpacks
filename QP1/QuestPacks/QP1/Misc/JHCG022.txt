<ce>               A beautiful sight, isn't it Pathfinder?
<ce>             A lone altar, a majestic hill, and the sight
<ce>              of the boundless ocean before you. That's
<ce>            always a favorite. I hope it is for you, too.
<ce>                 Take your pay. We'll be in contact.

<ce>                        hands you a parchment.

<ce>                   before moving on to other tasks.

  Pathfinder,
 
  Your assignment at this time is to chart the
  Coven on the Bluff. That's in Daggerfall. Please
  see me if you need directions.

<ce>                 A pleasure to see you, %pcf. You'll
<ce>                start at Burning Martyr of Kynareth in
<ce>               the Daggerfall region. It's by the coast
<ce>              on the west side. March south on the hills
<ce>              above the coastline. It shouldn't take you
<ce>              very long before you see an open clearing
<ce>                with an altar and a single witch. When
<ce>                you're done come back to me with your
<ce>                   report and you'll get your pay.

<ce>              You see the Coven on the Bluff before you.
                                     <--->
<ce>               A witch gestures to you before returning
<ce>                 to a ritual of some kind. This must
<ce>                    be the coven you were sent to.

 My assignment for the Cartographers
 is to chart the Coven on the Bluff in
 Daggerfall. My contact is _qg_
 in ___place_ in ____place_.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 _qg_ told me to start at
 Burning Martyr of Kynareth in
 the Daggerfall region. The coven
 should be a short walk to the south.
 It'll be in an open clearing above
 the ocean, on a hill crest.

<ce>                     Look for an open clearing to
<ce>                    the south of Burning Martyr of
<ce>                   Kynareth. You'll see the altar.
