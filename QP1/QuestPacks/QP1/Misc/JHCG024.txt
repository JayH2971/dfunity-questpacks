<ce>           I hope it was fairly easy to find. Have you ever
<ce>          spoken with witches? I hear a lot of nasty rumors
<ce>           about them, but they behaved quite civilly when
<ce>         I was on the circuit. Well, anyway, here's your fee.

  Pathfinder,
 
  We're sending you to the Coven of Dust, in
  Antiphyllos. Meet me in ___place_ if you
  need directions to find it. We're giving
  you =timer_ days to bring your report.

<ce>             All right, %pcf. Let's begin with your map.
<ce>              See this temple, Perpetual Sunrise of Mara
<ce>           in Antiphyllos? Start there and walk northeast.
<ce>           It'll be a couple of minutes before you can see
<ce>           the coven in the distance, but it should be easy
<ce>            to stop. It's a stone dome with sand covering
<ce>         the top of it. You'll have =timer_ days to do this.

%qdt:
 The Cartographers have tasked me
 with charting the Coven of Dust in
 Antiphyllos. I should do so and arrive
 at ___place_ at ____place_ within
 =timer_ days for my reward.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 _qg_ told me to start at
 Perpetual Sunrise of Mara in Antiphyllos
 and go straight northeast. The coven,
 a stone dome with a sandy covering,
 should be in few within a couple of minutes.

<ce>                 The vegetation out there is so arid,
<ce>                finding the coven site should be easy.
<ce>               You don't have to go very far to see it.
