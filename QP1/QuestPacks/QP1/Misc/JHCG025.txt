<ce>                  The Cartographers assigned you to
<ce>                    chart the Wroth Coven by now.

<ce>                  Well done, %pcf. These things are
<ce>            always a bother to find at the first, but once
<ce>             you've done it, you can keep doing the task
<ce>              with perfect confidence. We may never run
<ce>            out of charting assignments, even if you find
<ce>            yourself at the same locations once and again.

  Pathfinder,
 
  We need you to chart the Wroth Coven,
  in the Wrothgarian Mountains. I'm in
  ___place_ in case you need instructions.
  You have =timer_ days to fulfill this task.

<ce>                    Of course I'll help you, %pcf.
<ce>               Start in the village of Deerville in the
<ce>                 Wrothgarian Mountains. Specifically,
<ce>            stand next to a store called Deerville's Best
<ce>             General Store, and march east. If you follow
<ce>           that direction precisely, you should walk right
<ce>              over the stone circle of the Wroth Coven.
<ce>            There aren't any nearby landmarks or hills, so
<ce>          unfortunately that's all the direction I can give
<ce>              you. I will add that it's no further than
<ce>             two leagues out. Don't go wandering off into
<ce>            Skyrim looking for it. We've given you =timer_
<ce>                        days to do this task.

<ce>                    This must be the Wroth Coven.

<ce>                You've found the Wroth Coven. Now it's
<ce>                       time to report to _qg_.

 The Cartographers have sent me to
 the Wroth Coven in the Wrothgarian
 Mountains. I have =timer_ days to find
 it and arrive at ___place_
 in ____place_ for my reward.

%qdt:
 _qg_ said I should go to Deerville, to
 Deerville's Best General Store, and then
 just walk east. The coven is a stone circle
 in the middle of the greenery, not further
 than two leagues from the village.

<ce>              It's not always easy to find, since there
<ce>               aren't any landmarks besides Deerville.
<ce>              Watch for the jagged stones in the coven.
