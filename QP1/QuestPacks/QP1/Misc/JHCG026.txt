<ce>                   Your assignment to scout Castle

<ce>              Very good, Pathfinder. Did you take a look
<ce>           inside? Others have told me about awful moaning
<ce>            they hear from its depths. I'm happy to assign
<ce>          others to it all day long, even if it were to come
<ce>          out of my own pay. Speaking of pay, here's yours.

<ce>             "Letter, %pcf! The Cartographers!" A courier
<ce>           cheerfully puts a letter into your hands before
<ce>                      turning and walking away.

<ce>              A courier waves to you. "Hey, %ra! You're
<ce>            that Pathfinder with the Cartographers, right?
<ce>               This is for you!" You receive a letter.

  Pathfinder,
 
  We have an assignment which requires something
  of etiquette. Please do not divulge widely the terms
  of this mission. We need to send you to Castle
  Necromoghan in Daggerfall. If you do not understand
  the significance of it, do not ask. You have =timer_
  days to bring your report. Ask me if you need directions.
  Be certain to physically enter the location in this case
  to provide us with the most accurate chart possible.

<ce>               Before we begin, %pcf, I must emphasize
<ce>           once again the deep importance that no one know
<ce>         you are going to visit the place. Castle Necromoghan
<ce>         is not meant to be publicly known. We put it on some
<ce>                      maps, not on all of them.
 
<ce>         To arrive, I recommend beginning at the Singing Seer
<ce>     of Kynareth in the Daggerfall region. Press yourself against
<ce>      the northwesternmost house in the little community there.
<ce>  Then walk straight north. It's a bit of a trek, but it is supposed
<ce>     to be hidden, after all. Look for a mound in the earth with
<ce>   a decrepit door, lying before a small pond. There is no castle.
<ce>      My theory is that the name is meant to make people go look
<ce>    for a real castle and leave that place alone. But in any case,
<ce>    those instructions will be sufficient. You could alternatively
<ce>   start at The Old Yeomsley Shack and go east or Blessed Ascencion
<ce>         of Kynareth and go west. Castle Necromoghan is where
<ce>  all these points meet. And remember, we've given you =timer_ days.

<ce>           You've found Castle Necromoghan. The name is far
<ce>              more justified below ground than above it.
                                     <--->
<ce>      Strange as it must be, this has to be Castle Necromoghan.

%qdt:
 I've been sent to make a chart for
 the Cartographers from Castle
 Necromoghan to ___place_ in
 ____place_. I can go there to ask
 _qg_ for directions. I'll
 need to enter the castle to
 make my chart properly.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 The recommendation is to begin at
 Singing Seer of Kynareth in the
 Daggerfall region, at the house
 furthest to the northwest, and walk
 straight north. Castle Necromoghan
 will be a little mound in the earth.
 It's where Singing Seer of Kynareth,
 The Old Yeomsley Shack, and Blessed
 Ascencion of Kynareth meet.

<ce>                    Castle Necromoghan is meant to
<ce>                  be hard to find. Look where those
<ce>                three points converge. You'll see it.
