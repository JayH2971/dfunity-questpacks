<ce>                  The =timer_ days you were given to
<ce>                 chart Castle Llugwych have run out.

<ce>             Excellent. I do ask that you keep the place
<ce>           a secret. I will not say who the castle belongs
<ce>              to or what purpose it has. Some of my good
<ce>           ties to civilization might fray were I to do so.
<ce>               Let's change the subject, shall we? Here
<ce>                is the assignment fee, _reward_ gold.

<ce>                     thrusts it into your hands.

<ce>               A bored-looking page hands you a letter
<ce>                and departs before you can say a word.

  Pathfinder,
 
  Your next assignment is to chart the distance
  from Castle Llugwych in Ykalon to here. You
  are given =timer_ days. Speak to me if you
  don't know how to get there.

<ce>            Welcome, Pathfinder. Castle Llugwych is in the
<ce>         Ykalon region, far to the north. By far the easiest
<ce>         starting point is at a tiny wilderness shrine called
<ce>         the Altar of I'ric, which should already be on your
<ce>          map. From there just go south. If it's a clear day
<ce>             and you have good eyesight, Castle Llugwych
<ce>        might already be in view from there. It isn't directly
<ce>         to the south though, so make a slight adjustment to
<ce>          the east on the way. That should be enough to get
<ce>             you there. Report to me when you've done it.

<ce>         You've found Castle Llugwych. Who knows what secrets
<ce>             it holds out here, in the middle of nowhere.
                                     <--->
<ce>                This certainly has the appearance of a
<ce>                  castle. No doubt this is Llugwych.

 The Cartographers need me to report
 the distance from Castle Llugwych in
 Ykalon to ___place_ in ____place_.
 I can speak to _qg_
 if I don't know how to arrive.

%qdt:
 Castle Llugwych should be south
 and a little to the east of Altar
 of I'ric in Ykalon. It should also
 be visible on the horizon.

<ce>                    Castle Llugwych is one of the
<ce>                    easiest destinations to chart.
<ce>                      This assignment should be
<ce>                       considered a privilege.
