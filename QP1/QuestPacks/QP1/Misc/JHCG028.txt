<ce>              Did you see anyone important inside, %pcf?
<ce>            I suppose it's none of my business. I consort
<ce>           with enough important people in Tamriel already.
<ce>            But perhaps in a few years, one of the Master
<ce>            Assistant positions may open up and they could
<ce>        consider you for it! In the meantime, here's your fee.

<ce>            a scroll with the Cartographers' compass seal.

<ce>                 A courier unrolls a scroll from the
<ce>                  Cartographers and gives it to you.

  Pathfinder,
 
  We need a chart regarding Woodborne Hall.
  That's in Wayrest. This assignment will
  last =timer_ days. Come bring me your report
  after you've finished. Make sure you begin
  your chart from within the keep to get an
  accurate reading for this one.

<ce>             Good to see you, Pathfinder. This is likely
<ce>           the easiest assignment you'll ever get from us.
<ce>           Start at Tuncart in Wayrest. Go northwest, over
<ce>          the hill. Lord Woodborne's hall should be staring
<ce>             right at you once you're on top. It's nearly
<ce>        impossible to miss, so just look for an open clearing
<ce>                with a very impressive-looking castle.
 
<ce>        You didn't know Lord Woodborne had a castle, did you?
<ce>      Tuncart is well known for being one of his major refuges.
<ce>          He would hire his food, mead, and women there. The
<ce>        people of Tuncart have grown accustomed to seeing him
<ce>       in The Rat and Helm when there's no war campaign afoot.
<ce>        Come see me when you've finished. And as I wrote, make
<ce>        sure you start your report from within the keep door.

<ce>          This very well-maintained keep is Woodborne Hall.
                                     <--->
<ce>                You've found Woodborne Hall. Curiosity
<ce>                concerning its contents gnaws at you.

%qdt:
 The Cartographers have sent me
 to Woodborne Hall, and then to
 ___place_ in ____place_.
 _qg_ can give me
 any needed orientation.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 Woodborne Hall is right up the hill from
 Tuncart in Wayrest, to the northwest.

<ce>                    This is the easiest assignment
<ce>                     of all. We try to spread it
<ce>                      around as much as we can.
                                     <--->
<ce>                   That Woodborne made a brilliant
<ce>                   pick. A lakeside property on top
<ce>                   of a hill next to a quiet city?
<ce>                   Who could find better than that?
