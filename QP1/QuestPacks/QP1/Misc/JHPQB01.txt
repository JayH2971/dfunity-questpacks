<ce>    The Daedra slain, the Oghma Infinium clatters onto the ground.

  Please forgive my indiscretion. The Emperor
spoke to me concerning you and I have some
information to offer as aid. If what is herein
contained is of no use to you, please disregard
it and forget that I have bothered you.
 
  In the region of ____dung_ some ruins by the name
of ___dung_ lie in the wilderness. The place has
been adopted as a lair by a specimen of Oblivion, a
Daedra Lord named =enemy_. This on its own does not
merit so much attention were it not that another agent
in the region reported to us that the foe possesses an
artifact of great power called the Oghma Infinium.
The short conversation the two eked out suggested that
the foe will spend three more months in the cave, and once
it leaves, it intends to take the Oghma Infinium with it.
 
  My involvement in this matter is to inform you concerning
the object's existence and entreat you to employ all possible
means to recover it. Surely it will be a great aid to you.
 
  This letter will cease to be in one week's time from delivery,
and I request that you jot down all information of use. A map
to ___dung_ is included on the opposite side of this page.
 
                The Emperor's warmest greetings,
                The Great Knight

<ce>             According to the Great Knight, in this cave
<ce>             resides =enemy_. The Oghma Infinium awaits.

Message:  1013
<ce>               =enemy_ merely laughs at your intrusion.
<ce>      There will be only one way to retrieve the Oghma Infinium.
