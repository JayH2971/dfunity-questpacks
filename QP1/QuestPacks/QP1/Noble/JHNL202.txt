<ce>                    The Dark Brotherhood serves a
<ce>                  useful and legitimate purpose, so
<ce>               long as they are not spoken of publicly.
<ce>                 Ignorant minds make an outcry about
<ce>               the kind of work they do. Nevertheless,
<ce>                this last month they failed me in what
<ce>                 should have been a simple task. You
<ce>                   must wipe the slate clean of all
<ce>                        knowledgeable parties.

<ce>                    The only proper response. Your
<ce>                       objectives are in _loc1_
<ce>                             at ___loc1_,
<ce>                       and _loc2_, which is in
<ce>                       ___loc2_. Have done with
<ce>              both of them and I will grant you a magic
<ce>                 _reward_ from my own personal vault.
<ce>                   Take no more than =timer_ days.
<ce>                     Do not fail me as they have.

<ce>                   Smartly played, %pcf. Your work
<ce>                  lets me sleep at night. Have your
<ce>                        _reward_ as we agreed.

%qdt:
 _questgiver_ has ordered
 me to slay some foes. One is
 hiding in _loc1_ at
 ___loc1_, and the other is
 in _loc2_, within
 ___loc2_. I must
 return to ___questgiver_
 in =timer_ days for my reward,
 an enchanted _reward_.

<ce>                        I do not know how long
<ce>                        my foes will remain in
<ce>                        ___loc1_ and ___loc2_.
<ce>                       Find them and kill them.
