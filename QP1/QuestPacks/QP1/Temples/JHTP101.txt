<ce>            %pct, regardless of your past accomplishments
<ce>           and your history, all must carry their weight in

<ce>               to be in _res_. We do not expect you to
<ce>             preach to %g2. We instead have this written
<ce>           package you may deliver, which we will consider
<ce>              success on your part. The task is simple.
<ce>         Return here within =timer_ days to curry our favor.

<ce>                   Ah, this is that tract __qgiver_
<ce>                   had promised me. Thank you, %ra.
<ce>              Would you be willing to tell me more about
<ce>              its contents? Ah, well, I'm sure you won't
<ce>               be the last messenger they send me. I'll
<ce>             spend a few days considering this material.
<ce>                Give the regular preachers my regards.
