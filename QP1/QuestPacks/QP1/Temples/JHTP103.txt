QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>              %pcf, one of our good members in ___dest_
<ce>      is suffering under some sort of cruel illness. We usually
<ce>         employ our healers for our own, but the sickness is
<ce>     clearly not life-threatening. We merely wish to shorten the
<ce>        recovery period from weeks to days. With this pack of
<ce>              _herb_, _npc_ will soon recover in a most
<ce>      satisfactory manner. Can we rely on you to take it to %g2?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>        The workload in this temple will increase without %g2.
<ce>                Are you certain that's your decision?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>         Our most sincere gratitude to you. _npc_ is resting
<ce>            in _dest_, which is in ___dest_. The delivery
<ce>       should be sufficient, I believe, as %g1 will know how to
<ce>      make use of it. We can't afford to pay you much for this,
<ce>      but such is our work. I will see you within =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>          You were expected to return to ___qgiver_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             _qgiver_ hands you the =reward_ gold pieces
<ce>              and thanks you again for your dedication.

Message:  1020
<ce>           Who are you? %oth, you've come from ___qgiver_?
<ce>       I wish I would not worry them so. But I suppose there is
<ce>     an abundance of work to do. I'll take the _herb_. Thank you.
<ce>     Tell them I will take up my journey by the end of next week.

Message:  1021
<ce>        How was _npc_ looking? This is something that happens
<ce>         every few months with %g2. Someone told me we should
<ce>        just invest in some house where %g1 can live here, but
<ce>      that's the same money problem. Speaking of money, it isn't
<ce>      a lot, but it's what we can offer. Please understand that
<ce>    even in small things the divine feels pleasure. Slaying daedra
<ce>        on assignment and delivering herbs on assignment mean
<ce>                   all the same to the gods above.

Message:  1025
<ce>       What is this? The temple sent you? Oh, dear. I fear your
<ce>      journey was a bit of a miscalculation. I have overcome the
<ce>   illness in a most stellar fashion over the last couple of days,
<ce>        and feel ready even now to resume my services. But now
<ce>        that you're here, why not go together? Let me just get
<ce>     my things and I am more than happy to take you for a guide.

Message:  1026
<ce>          Ah, how wonderful to see you, _npc_! I'm sorry we
<ce>        had to send our good friend %pcf out to fetch you, but
<ce>      all is well that ends well. How good that you could travel
<ce>     together for safety's sake. Here's your reward all the same,
<ce>        %pcf. I'll take the _herb_ back if you still have it.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 I must deliver a quantity
 of _herb_ to _npc_,
 who is sick in _dest_ 
 at ___dest_. I must then
 return to ___qgiver_
 in =timer_ days.

Message:  1031
%qdt:

 accompany me to ___qgiver_.
