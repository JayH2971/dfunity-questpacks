QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>            %pcf, we worry for the well-being of our dear
<ce>                friend _rescue_, who took leave for a
<ce>                  pilgrimage to ___dung_ a few weeks
<ce>         ago. Though our general practice is to let pilgrims
<ce>            have their solace, there are some exceptional
<ce>            cases that warrant a check-up. We ask that you
<ce>       go for %g2 and bring %g2 to the light of day once more.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>      A saddening response, %pcf. What will we do for %g2 then?
                                     <--->
<ce>              I suppose we could send you for the corpse
<ce>                in a few weeks. Is that what you want?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Wonderful, my friend. Thank you.
<ce>               I hope we will find %g3 prediction to be
<ce>                false after all, for %g1 was muttering
<ce>               something about a death curse and so on.
<ce>                We immediately granted the request for
<ce>           leave of absence, you see. In any case, what say
<ce>             we see you here in =timer_ days? I consider
<ce>           that to be ample time for the purpose. Farewell.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                      _qgiver_ sighs deeply, and
<ce>                  you consider the matter concluded.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
They told me ___qgiver_'s a good place to live. What do you think?
<--->
Have you been to ___qgiver_ recently? I like it.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Welcome, %pcf. ___dung_ will soon fear your name.
<--->
Your skill and reputation are welcome here, %pcf.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ in ___qgiver_
 has sent me to find _rescue_
 in ___dung_. I have
 =timer_ days to return.

Message:  1011
<ce>                  A loud shout nearly startles you.
<ce>
<ce>           "You there! _qgiver_ sent you, didn't %g1? Take
<ce>           me away from here! I need to get to ___qgiver_!"
<ce>
<ce>                     _rescue_ happily joins you.
                                     <--->
<ce>            Someone comes into view, startled to see you.
<ce>
<ce>            "Excuse me! I need to get back to ___qgiver_.
<ce>                Can you help me? My name is _rescue_."
<ce>
<ce>                     You tell %g2 to follow you.

Message:  1012
<ce>           Ah, _rescue_, what a joy it is to see you again.
<ce>         Was the pilgrimage worth it? Most people never again
<ce>        venture under the earth after an experience like that,
<ce>         hence why we granted your request. Now then, we have
<ce>           much work for you to do. No time for nightmares.
<ce>               And have you thanked %pcn? You would be
<ce>      dead now if it weren't for %g2. Our sincerest thanks once
<ce>                           more, good %pct.

Message:  1020
<ce>           You hear shambling steps nearby. A voice croaks,
<ce>
<ce>            "The King of Worms has given me a better form.
<ce>                He wishes to bestow the gift on you."
<ce>
<ce>              You notice the form's mouth does not move.
<ce>               Clearly powerful magicks are in effect.
<ce>                     You prepare to put _rescue_
<ce>                          out of %g3 misery.
                                     <--->
<ce>           You hear halting steps nearby, and then a voice.
<ce>
<ce>         "My best regards to _qgiver_. Soon I will see %g2."
<ce>
<ce>             It appears the curse was more than fiction.
<ce>               _rescue_'s only salvation is death now.

Message:  1021
<ce>         You wish it weren't necessary, but this was all that
<ce>                you could do. Time to inform _qgiver_.

Message:  1022
<ce>              Tell me, what happened? Where is _rescue_?
<ce>
<ce>       Oh, I think I'm going to be sick. Only the Necromancers
<ce>      could do such a thing. Oh, this is perilous. Could I have
<ce>          changed something if I did not grant %g3 request?
<ce>        Could we have cured %g2? Oh, my. No, I refuse to think
<ce>         about this more today. Not today. Tomorrow, perhaps.
<ce>         No more. Thank you for doing your duty. That is all.
                                     <--->
<ce>              Welcome back, %pcf, but where is _rescue_?
<ce>
<ce>         That is horrifying. Now I wonder whether %g1 brought
<ce>          the curse on by %g3 own actions or whether it was
<ce>         involuntary. Oh, if only we could know. Let us hope
<ce>         never to hear something like this again. Thank you,
<ce>                    %pcf. You have done your duty.
