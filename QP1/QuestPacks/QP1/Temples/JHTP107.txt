<ce>                  %pct, I'm at my wit's end. The %t
<ce>                has ordered us to cleanse a persistent
<ce>                      infection in ___dung_ that
<ce>                refuses to come out. I've already lost
<ce>                =dummy_ members to it, all healers of
<ce>              various kinds. If you decide to take this
<ce>           up, will you promise me you'll come back alive?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                I'm happy and sad at your answer, for
<ce>                 I truly hoped to be done with this.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Oh, well, I suppose I can find a little
<ce>               joy in your promise then. The depths are
<ce>                 absolutely washed in typhoid fever.
<ce>                No matter how often you cure it, it'll
<ce>            come back. Please see me again in =timer_ days
<ce>                with the job done. I have reserved an
<ce>                 enchanted _reward_ for you. They are
<ce>               difficult to come by, but this occasion
<ce>              merits it. Fight with all the strength you
<ce>          have, and do not succumb to the illness. Farewell.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                      The =timer_ days _qgiver_
<ce>                 gave you to cleanse ___dung_ are up.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                What a joy! So the cause was a walking
<ce>            corpse? Better than some human with such power
<ce>             over the miasma, for that would only terrify
<ce>                 me all the more. Take this _reward_.
<ce>            You are certainly making a name for yourself.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
I got a fever the other day. Temples are good for that.

Message:  1020
<ce>           This place stinks terribly. There's no question
<ce>            any amount of time here will bring an illness.

Message:  1021
<ce>                This zombie seemed to radiate the odor
<ce>               penetrating this whole area. The problem
<ce>                     appears to now be resolved.
