QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>           Have you any ability to dispel the undead, %pct?
<ce>          Any variant of the spell will do. It just requires
<ce>         that you cast it yourself. Bit of nefarious dealings
<ce>       with the Necromancers that we've been asked to clean up.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>       I may have to send out to the Mages Guild for this one.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>       I'll take your word for it. We were quite surprised when
<ce>        the %t sent us word that a local couple had lent their
<ce>         house to the Necromancers for several dark rituals.
<ce>      They've since had a change of heart and asked us for help
<ce>      in removing the influence of the undead from their abode.
<ce>
<ce>      Lest you think this will be a normal trip to slay a mummy,
<ce>            I forewarn you that it will not be. Find some
<ce>          comfortable place in the house to cast the dispel
<ce>        effect and then remain in the building. If you leave,
<ce>     things will get much worse. Your life force will sustain the
<ce>      divine influence while you remain there. I suspect it will
<ce>       take about twenty-four hours for the purge to complete.
<ce>             Such is the power of the wicked Necromancers
<ce>             once you let them wield a little influence.
<ce>           I'll expect you to arrive by this time tomorrow.
<ce>                 Look for _res_ here near in ___res_.
<ce>                 I will await your successful report.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>              _questgiver_ needed you to begin removing
<ce>                 the dark influence of _res_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>    The difference in ___res_ is palpable, even from here. I need
<ce>     no further proof of your doings. Darkness has fled a little
<ce>             this day. Fine work, %pcf. Take this _tri_.

Message:  1010
<ce>       This is clearly the right building. The residents should
<ce>             feel relief to see you, but are disturbed by
<ce>                       the malignant influence.

Message:  1011
<ce>                           "No... No! NO!"
<ce>
<ce>        The Necromancers have bound a spirit here to maintain
<ce>           their influence. This will be a long day indeed.

Message:  1012
<ce>                   The spirit that lingers here has
<ce>           been given power to materialize multiple times.
<ce>          The Necromancers' power is not to be trifled with.

Message:  1013
<ce>         "Begone... Begone... Begone... Begone... Begone..."

Message:  1014
<ce>                    "Death comes for you, %ra..."

Message:  1015
<ce>                 "How long will I endure this pain?"

Message:  1016
<ce>                 "Please, stop, stop, stop, stop..."

Message:  1017
<ce>          "Are you my missing child? Come to me, sweetie..."

Message:  1018
<ce>        "Cease... this... incantation... for... my... pain..."

Message:  1019
<ce>                 "Release me from undeath! Free me!"

Message:  1020
<ce>           "You will regret challenging the Necromancers!"

Message:  1021
<ce>           "Darkness will always devour the light, mortal."

Message:  1022
<ce>           "Quickly, leave this place... I will give in..."

Message:  1023
<ce>             "I'm almost free! Please, leave the building
<ce>                      and cast the spell anew!"

Message:  1024
<ce>                   "Give in and become as we are!"

Message:  1025
<ce>    The effect has taken permanent hold. The spirit bound to this
<ce>    home dissipates, impotent to work further in the mortal realm.
<ce>                 _questgiver_ will await your report.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _questgiver_ has sent me to purify
 _res_, a local home, from
 the Necromancers' influence.
 I am to cast any spell to dispel the undead
 within and then remain inside for twenty-four
 hours. I should begin before a day has passed.

Message:  1031
<ce>           You leave the residence and suddenly hear a loud
<ce>      whooping sound come from within, then above, the building.
<ce>       The malignant influence you were trapping and nullifying
<ce>    springs free of its confines and rushes out into the open air.
<ce>        Soon it will be under the control of the Necromancers
<ce>                  for yet another villainous scheme.
