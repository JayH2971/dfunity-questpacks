<ce>              A citizen of ___questgiver_ has requested
<ce>          the temple's aid in curing oneself of lycanthropy,
<ce>         or werewolfism. We don't know what that will entail,
<ce>           but we're happy to reduce Tamriel's beast count.
<ce>           We need to send some combat-ready person to aid.
<ce>                      Can we count on your help?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>      Very well. We want someone who is certainly ready for it.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Good. Find _person_ in _res_,
<ce>          to the %di of here. That's our poor infected soul.
<ce>              Your mission is to rid %g2 of lycanthropy.
<ce>    You'll get your instructions when you speak to %g2, I suppose.
<ce>                       %god help your endeavor.

<ce>            _person_ will no more suffer from lycanthropy.

RumorsPostSuccess:  [1007]
_person_ will never stop talking about you.
<--->
_person_ donated a ton of money to __questgiver_.
<--->
_person_'s cured of werewolfism! It's possible after all!

Message:  1010
<ce>                 Greetings. __questgiver_? Welcome to
<ce>          my abode. I've done most of the footwork to find a
<ce>         cure to my fearsome condition, and now the last step
<ce>        remains. I lack the courage to do it myself, and need
<ce>              your help. Let us be off to ___farhouse_.
<ce>          We must find _kid_, who holds the key to my cure.
<ce>            That is what the alchemist told me, at least.

Message:  1011
<ce>                  _person_ leans down and speaks to
<ce>                this child. "Excuse me, you're _kid_,
<ce>         aren't you?" The child nods cautiously in response.
<ce>
<ce>          _person_ begins unpacking several things from %g3
<ce>       belongings, including a few weapons and a vial of blood.
<ce>           "Okay %pcf, this is what we have to do. You get
<ce>       this kid to drink this," %g1 says, pointing to the vial.
<ce>      "Then get ready to run, 'cause things are gonna get ugly."
<ce>
<ce>     You understand why %g1 kept these details secret until now.
<ce>       As if to assuage any hesitation on your part, %g1 says,
<ce>       "You want to know the truth? This kid's a werewolf, just
<ce>        like me. Sooner or later it's gonna come out and start
<ce>        murdering people. You can't help it. It needs a cure.
<ce>        I want that cure, and there's no other way than this.
<ce>              I've done my research! I've seen it all!"
<ce>
<ce>                _kid_ begins crying, hearing the many
<ce>                  scary words in this conversation.
<ce>             Do you join _person_ to help %g2 get rid of
<ce>                           %g3 lycanthropy?

Message:  1012
<ce>          You agreed to help _person_ get cured, and this is
<ce>            the price to pay. You send %g2 outside so you
<ce>             can calm the child down. Convincing _kid_ to
<ce>        drink the werewolf blood is easier than you expect --
<ce>      perhaps this talk of latent lycanthropy is true after all.
<ce>         It doesn't take long before %g1 starts groaning and
<ce>          writhing, turning into a werewolf in front of you.

Message:  1013
<ce>        _person_ pops back into the room, sobbing with relief.
<ce>
<ce>    "I could feel it! The moment of the transformation, I knew it!
<ce>            I'm free! By %god, my life is mine once more!
<ce>      Thank you, %pct! __questgiver_ has my thanks forevermore!"
<ce>
<ce>       You gain no reward, but hope the temple has a very firm
<ce>                 ally in ___questgiver_ from now on.

Message:  1014
<ce>    "You're not getting in my way. I've come too far and done too
<ce>             much to stop now. This has to happen, now!"
<ce>
<ce>           _kid_ cowers in fear and then runs out the door.
<ce>        _person_ turns to you, %g3 cowardice consumed in rage.
<ce>
<ce>          "I'll find that kid, but I can't let you stop me!
<ce>           I need to do this, even if I have to kill you!"

Message:  1015
<ce>               You've spared _kid_ by slaying _person_.
<ce>            Though __questgiver_ may not have intended it,
<ce>                  this certainly solves the problem.

Message:  1016
<ce>         You flee the house. Shortly thereafter, you hear the
<ce>               screams of a child, which are cut short.
<ce>         It appears _person_ didn't need your help after all.

Message:  1017
<ce>           You've taken too long, and _person_ leaves you.

Message:  1018
<ce>           You find _person_ outside, sobbing with relief.
<ce>
<ce>    "I could feel it! The moment of the transformation, I knew it!
<ce>            I'm free! By %god, my life is mine once more!
<ce>      Thank you, %pct! __questgiver_ has my thanks forevermore!"
<ce>
<ce>       You gain no reward, but hope the temple has a very firm
<ce>                 ally in ___questgiver_ from now on.
