<ce>         Rumors spread of a daedric cohort in ___questgiver_,
<ce>      one who wishes to bring Oblivion's influence into Tamriel.
<ce>       We cannot abide this, and wish to send someone to settle
<ce>          this matter. Will you do some fact-finding for us?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>            No problem. I presume it will be an easy task.

<ce>           "Because we think two minds surpass one, we have
<ce>           taken on another investigator to accompany you.
<ce>                  %pcn, meet _friend_. You two will
<ce>             search the city for any clues about _cohort_
<ce>    and the daedra. Have finished with this in three days' time."
<ce>
<ce>                _friend_ enthusiastically shakes your
<ce>        hand and begins to follow you. "We'll figure this out,
<ce>                     yes we will! Let's go %pcf!"
<ce>
<ce>              Before you leave, _questgiver_ speaks up.
<ce>              "%pcf, you have the authority to make the
<ce>             final decision here, being the higher rank.
<ce>           _friend_'s job is only to assist you. Farewell."

<ce>                You hope you made the right decision.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
__questgiver_'s looking out for us common folk. Good for them!
<--->
A couple investigators from the temple are looking for daedra.

Message:  1010
<ce>                _friend_ speaks up, "Well, we can ask
<ce>        people around town if they know anything. Once we get
<ce>             some evidence, we can ask _cohort_ about it.
<ce>               I know %g1's the owner of _coshop_, and
<ce>               stays there most of the time. Now then,
<ce>                   I'll follow you. Lead the way!"

Message:  1011
<ce>                  _friend_ steps forward. "_cohort_,
<ce>           we come from __questgiver_ on rumors that you're
<ce>               working with the daedra. Is that true?"
<ce>
<ce>        _cohort_ looks a little shocked but recovers quickly.
<ce>        "Why, no, not at all! I'm a sworn enemy of the daedra.
<ce>        I wish nothing but their banishment from all Tamriel!
<ce>          Feel free to look around. I have nothing to hide."
<ce>
<ce>                       _friend_ shrugs at you.

Message:  1012
<ce>                Ooh! You're them investigators sent by
<ce>              __questgiver_, right? I'll talk! I'll say
<ce>             anything you want! Just give me 100 gold and
<ce>                  I'll squawk like a birdie, I will!

Message:  1013
<ce>                  "100! That's the stuff! Yeah, so,
<ce>              I can tell you lots of stuff. _cohort_ has
<ce>             had a fascination with daedra since %g1 was
<ce>              a young'un, I'm sure. Powerful creatures!
<ce>       The kind of stuff a kid would love to dabble in. And I'm
<ce>        a living, breathing witness! I hear whispering coming
<ce>       way out of that house all the way to mine, every night!
<ce>                     That, my friends, is proof!"
<ce>
<ce>             As excitable as _neighbor_ is, this is still
<ce>                      evidence to follow up on.

Message:  1014
<ce>        Then I can't help y'all, gruel brains. Git outta here.

Message:  1015
<ce>                      No money? I'll wait here.

Message:  1016
<ce>                    _friend_ recoils at the sight.
<ce>                "This is blood! Human blood, isn't it?
<ce>            And look at the name written in it: _cohort_!
<ce>             Why, this is proof positive! What else could
<ce>                  it mean than that %g1 is guilty?"
<ce>
<ce>               This is something to ask _cohort_ about.

Message:  1017
<ce>            You find a letter here, which _friend_ reads.
<ce>
<ce>               "Our dear friend _cohort_, we thank thee
<ce>               with fulsome hearts for thy benevolence.
<ce>      Thou hast done much good with thy kin in ____questgiver_,
<ce>             speaking well of us and pacifying our foes.
<ce>            Visit us any time for a hospitality far beyond
<ce>                   that of the peoples of Tamriel.
<ce>
                             Thy sisters forever,
                             The Glenmoril Coven"
<ce>
<ce>    "Cohorting with witches. That's what a daedra lover would do!"
<ce>           _friend_ shouts. "Let's show this to _cohort_!"

Message:  1018
<ce>           Suddenly, an ear-shattering boom splits the air.
<ce>          The ground quakes slightly, and as you look at the
<ce>        force's origin, you see a creature from another plane.
<ce>                       It laughs and advances.

Message:  1019
<ce>          "This is terrifying! I'm never doing this again!"
<ce>                _friend_ screams. "Let's be done with
<ce>              this! That attack is evidence! _cohort_ is
<ce>                     trying to stop us! Come on!"

Message:  1020
<ce>          You tell _cohort_ about _neighbor_'s accusations.
<ce>
<ce>          "Whisperings coming from my house? That is a lie!
<ce>       How can you even hear whispering from another building?
<ce>               _neighbor_ has hated me for years, ever
<ce>          since I slept with the wrong person in %g3 family.
<ce>         It was wrong and I've made amends, but %g1 will not
<ce>                    forgive me! Do not trust %g2!"

Message:  1021
<ce>            You show _cohort_ the letter from the witches.
<ce>
<ce>            "Yes, that letter is from the Glenmoril Coven.
<ce>       Years ago they healed my eye when the gods of the Empire
<ce>     abandoned me. These sisters have power, and I wish everyone
<ce>       could benefit from it. But to summon daedra? No, never!
<ce>            I hate the daedra, same as anyone else here!"

Message:  1022
<ce>         You tell _cohort_ you saw %g3 name written in blood.
<ce>
<ce>  "That's impossible! I haven't been to that place this week, even!
<ce>    I do not know anything about this, and have no idea who could
<ce>     be setting me up! And besides, since when do the daedra ask
<ce>       you to write your own name in blood? This has nothing to
<ce>                        do with me, I swear!"

Message:  1023
<ce>         You tell _cohort_ that the daedra have attacked you.
<ce>
<ce>          "You're trying to blame that on me? What did I do
<ce>       to deserve this? I have nothing to do with any of this!
<ce>              I'm glad the monster is gone! I'm serious,
<ce>                      I'm completely innocent!"

Message:  1024
<ce>                        _friend_ turns to you.
<ce>             "Well, it looks like we've done work enough.
<ce>           _questgiver_ says the decision is yours to make.
<ce>             They'll want an answer soon. So what is it?
<ce>                 Is _cohort_ a friend of the daedra?"

Message:  1025
<ce>                 "I agree! I'll go grab some guards!"
<ce>
<ce>            _friend_ sprints off and returns with a squad
<ce>             of the city guard. They burst into _coshop_
<ce>              and soon emerge with _cohort_ in manacles.
<ce>             You hear %g2 cry, "No, please! I'm innocent!
<ce>              %oth, you can't do this! Please, no, no!"
<ce>             They carry %g2 off to fulfil your decision.

Message:  1026
<ce>        "Well, I don't like it, but I'll follow. I agree that
<ce>      the evidence isn't perfect... I just we had more to go on.
<ce>      The decision is yours, and you'll have to live with that."
<ce>
<ce>        _friend_ shakes your hand half-heartedly and departs.
<ce>       _cohort_, if guilty, is now free to flee ___questgiver_
<ce>                    and its remaining suspicions.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 __questgiver_ has paired me with
 a fellow temple member named _friend_
 to investigate rumors of a cohort of the daedra
 in ___questgiver_ named _cohort_.
 We should ask around about evidence against
 %g2 and show them to %g2 in _coshop_.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 We received some rather excited testimony
 from a neighbor of _cohort_ named
 _neighbor_. We should take this
 evidence to _cohort_.

Message:  1032
%qdt:
 _cohort_ told us this neighbor
 has a vendetta against %g2 and
 should not be trusted.

Message:  1033
%qdt:
 We found _cohort_'s name written in blood
 in _cohouse_, %g3 other residence.

Message:  1034
%qdt:
 _cohort_ claims %g1 hasn't visited the
 other residence for days, and questioned
 the purpose of %g3 own name being written
 in blood.

Message:  1035
%qdt:
 We found a letter from some witches
 in _otherres_ explaining that
 _cohort_ has a long history with them.

Message:  1036
%qdt: 
 _cohort_ confessed to spending time with
 witches, but only for their healing arts,
 and not to summon daedra.

Message:  1037
%qdt:
 _friend_ and I were attacked by
 one of the daedra while investigating
 _cohort_'s case. Perhaps this
 is also evidence against %g2.

Message:  1038
%qdt:
 _cohort_ told us %g1 hates
 the daedra and is glad the
 creature is gone.

Message:  1039
<ce>              __questgiver_ gave you three days to judge
<ce>            _cohort_'s case. Your time is up, and judgment
<ce>                      will be given to another.

Message:  1055
_cohort_ has a neighbor named _neighbor_, spends %g3 time at _tavern_. Talks a lot, you know?
<--->
_cohort_ stays in _coshop_ but lives elsewhere, in _cohouse_.
<--->
_cohort_ pays to store some old belongings in _otherres_.
