QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>          Our long-running feud with the Mages Guild should
<ce>         not surprise anyone. They have repeatedly stolen our
<ce>         work and claimed it as their own, to name the least
<ce>         of their crimes against us. But we are informed that
<ce>          one of our members has been stolen away and forced
<ce>         to work in a Mages Guild hall, far from ___qgiver_.
<ce>           Julianos requires a brave soul to bring us back
<ce>                       our friend. Will you go?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                   Remember, if it happened to you,
<ce>              one of us would rescue you. Remember that.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                   Julianos smiles upon thee, %pct.
<ce>             You will travel to ___magery_ to find =apoc_
<ce>                 named _apoc_ within the mages' hall.
<ce>     You should expect resistance once your intentions are known,
<ce>              but neither we nor the law would hold you
<ce>               accountable should you defend yourself.
<ce>         The Mages Guild generally prefers a few dead bodies
<ce>    in lieu of the %rt finding out what they really do over there.
<ce>           However your method, return here in =timer_ days
<ce>             with _apoc_ intact. Should that time expire,
<ce>              others will be sent in your place, and you
<ce>                      will be dubbed a failure.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                   You were to return to ___qgiver_
<ce>                      with _apoc_ by this time.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>            _apoc_ wildly thrashes about as %g1 recognizes
<ce>           the familiar faces of the adherents of Julianos.
<ce>          Healers approach and begin the long, arduous work
<ce>         of dispelling the Mages Guild's enchantment on %g2,
<ce>           pulling %g2 into another room. _qgiver_ speaks.
<ce>
<ce>                "It isn't pretty, but it is necessary.
<ce>               The Mages Guild will pay for its crimes,
<ce>             even if the whole Empire should burn for it.
<ce>          Julianos' wrath will be poured out in its season.
<ce>            As for you, I managed to get my hands on this
<ce>              fairly unique _item_ while you were away.
<ce>                  Would you accept it as a reward?"

Message:  1010
<ce>                A tense air reigns in the Mages Guild.
<ce>           The people here seem to know something is wrong,
<ce>        but they aren't brave enough to do anything about it.
<ce>
<ce>     You hope none of them get in your way once you find _apoc_.

Message:  1011
<ce>             This =apoc_ matches the description _qgiver_
<ce>          gave you of _apoc_. However, %g3 eyes are distant,
<ce>            and %g1 appears to bear no conscious thought.
<ce>     You grab %g3 wrist, and though %g1 offers little resistance,
<ce>             %g1 is impelled to shout, "H-help! Enemies!
<ce>                  They're coming to take me away!!"

Message:  1012
<ce>         A serious-looking group from the Temple of Julianos
<ce>          have found you. They take _apoc_ from your custody
<ce>                     and lead %g2 to ___qgiver_.
<ce>                       Your reward is forfeit.
