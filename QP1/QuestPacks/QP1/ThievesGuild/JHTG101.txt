QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>         Sometimes in the guild we like to kick back for some
<ce>        sport. Got an invitation you might want to listen to.
<ce>           There's a treasure chest in a crypt around here
<ce>         that's infested with bats. If you can find the chest
<ce>           and bring it back here without killing any bats,
<ce>                you get =reward_ gold. Want in?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  We'll see if you change your mind.

<ce>             "All right, let us just do one thing before
<ce>                      we tell you where it is."
<ce>
<ce>        A robed figure enters, casts two short spells on you,
<ce>              and leaves. You don't feel any different.
<ce>
<ce>          "There. Now we'll be able to see you, and the bats
<ce>        will come swarming after you. Kill none of them in the
<ce>                   crypt, place called ___mondung_.
<ce>             The spell won't last forever, so get on back
<ce>             here in =timer_ days with the chest in hand.
<ce>              You'll be getting =reward_ gold
<ce>                    if you do it. Take care now."

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                You needed to deliver the chest to the
<ce>                        Thieves Guild by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>          That was a thrill to watch. A bunch of us gathered
<ce>             around and shared some mead, made some bets.
<ce>                Wish we could do it more often. Here's
<ce>               your gold. Hope it serves you well.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 I've been given a challenge by the Thieves Guild
 to find a certain chest in ___mondung_
 and deliver it to them in ___questgiver_
 within =timer_ days. I can't kill any
 bats inside the place.

Message:  1011
<ce>         As your hand touches this chest, a magical insignia
<ce>         appears in front of you. This must be the right one.
<ce>        You're disappointed to see it's empty, but it's still
<ce>                          yours to deliver.

Message:  1012
<ce>       As this bat falls, a design like a skull appears before
<ce>         your eyes. The Thieves Guild knows you have failed.

Message:  1013
<ce>          You can already hear the faint chittering of bats.
