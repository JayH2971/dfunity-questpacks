<ce>                   %pcf, we're working out a plan.
<ce>               We're usually in the business of moving
<ce>                jewels, powders, and money around, but
<ce>                 right now we want to move a person.
<ce>                          Wanna help us out?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                  You weren't gonna pick 'im up and
<ce>                 carry him in your arms, halfwit. The
<ce>                   guild needs this kind of money.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>              All right then. What you're gonna have to
<ce>                     do is head over to ___res_.
<ce>                The kid's gonna be waiting inside some
<ce>                      place called _res_. Name's
<ce>                       _kid_. Grab %g2 fast and
<ce>                     get moving to __dung_. We'll
<ce>                 have someone inside waiting to take
<ce>                 %g2 off your hands. You'll get your
<ce>                    reward then. Get moving, %pcf.
<ce>                       You've got =timer_ days.

<ce>                By now the city guard will have caught
<ce>                 on to the guild's kidnapping scheme.

<ce>                A man in a grey tunic motions to you.
<ce>
<ce>                  "Thieves Guild, right? Good. I'll
<ce>                       take _kid_ from here. We
<ce>                  need to find a place to hide until
<ce>                   we get the ransom money. Here's
<ce>                   your take. Now leave us alone."

<ce>                    The house is quiet. It appears
<ce>                     no one suspected your entry.

Message:  1021
<ce>                     _kid_ stares at you in fear.
<ce>                    "Who are you? Where's Daddy?"
<ce>
<ce>                    You gag %g2 and cover %g2 with
<ce>                 a heavy cloak nearby. Now to deliver
