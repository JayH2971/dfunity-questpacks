<ce>           We've got a bit more hands-on action this time.
<ce>            Some land deed of some kind to a house over in
<ce>              ___dummy_. It's kept by someone staying at
<ce>                    _dest_ in ___dest_. Mere pick-
<ce>      pocketing isn't gonna cut it with this one. A good impact,
<ce>        non-lethal, is more likely to get it free. It's paying
<ce>                    =reward_ gold if you want in.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             Well, I'm sure I have easier stuff to offer.
                                     <--->
<ce>               Why? The "no killing" part turn you off?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>       And we have our %ra. Get it back here in =queston_ days.
<ce>        Make sure you go at night, like after ten. Less ruckus
<ce>        that way. This won't take pickpocketing; a good, heavy
<ce>      smack should let you get it into your hands, but I'm just
<ce>       gonna say this once: if you kill the carrier, there will
<ce>         be no forgiveness for you. At least not on my part.
<ce>              I'll have the money here after. Get to it.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             There it is. This kind of thing can make you
<ce>            a person of influence. Well done. Here's your
<ce>           gold. I'll try to arrange these kinds of things
<ce>                        for you in the future.

QuestLogEntry:  [1010]
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ told me to go
 to ___dest_ to steal a
 land deed from _dest_.
 I should go in after midnight.
 I can't kill the carrier, but some fighting
 might have to be done to get it free.
 I've got =queston_ days to get it done
 and go back to ___qgiver_.

<ce>
<ce>                A paper falls from your enemy's pack.
<ce>                        You now have the deed.

Message:  1021
<ce>                With the killing blow made, you wonder
<ce>              about your future with the Thieves Guild.

<ce>            A middle-aged figure wearing a hood offers you
<ce>                 a letter and departs without a word.

Message:  1041
%ra,
 
Would you like to make =bigmoney_ gold pieces? Bring
that deed to me. You know _qgiver_ has no
legitimate claim to it, nor %g3 client. My agent will
receive it at ___divers_. Look inside
_divers_.

Message:  1042
<ce>           Very wise decision. The Thieves Guild is usually
<ce>         reliable, and yet on occasion gets in over its head.
<ce>              You have saved everyone a great headache.
<ce>              My master thanks you, though %g1 could not
<ce>                          be here. Farewell.

<ce>               Everyone! The %ra's here! Get over here!
                                     <--->
<ce>           Ah, there you are. Thank you for coming. Reward
<ce>        money? No one told me about that. I'll be taking that
<ce>                   deed from you in just a moment.

Message:  1050
<ce>         No, I had already heard. Spymaster's good for that.
<ce>       You're pathetic. I'll take the deed but you get nothing.
<ce>                              Get lost.

Message:  1055
<ce>          This was a waste of time. Now to get to _qgiver_.
