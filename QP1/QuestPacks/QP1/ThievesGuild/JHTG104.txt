<ce>  We've got a complicated matter on our hands.
<ce>  _dummy_'s been caught. Did you meet
<ce>  him before they got him? Anyway, he's locked up and
<ce>  awaiting trial, and it was for a huge hit. That's why the
<ce>  trial's being postponed. They're gathering evidence and
<ce>  locking it up in ___pal_. We need someone who
<ce>  can grab the idiot's confession before the trial
<ce>  in =2pal_ days. Help us out here.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  Then I'm not bribing for you anymore. No way.
<--->
<ce>  You really think he deserves it? Whatever.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Here's the plan. It's in the Palace at ___pal_.
<ce> We know the place has some serious defenses about it.
<ce> You won't be able to tell 'til the thing's picked up.
<ce> Once you have it, use this _trinket_ right away.
<ce> It'll send you off outta their hands. Kind of a complicated
<ce> getaway, but they'd take your skin if they could for this.
<ce> After that you can take your merry time coming back,
<ce> but you've gotta pick it up in less than =2pal_ days or
<ce> the trial's gonna happen. No time to lose. See you later.

<ce>  It hardly feels like you left, doesn't it %pcf?
<ce>  The things we do for a brother. Well, you proved
<ce>  your mettle this time. Take your reward. Good work.

Message:  1010
<ce>  You activate the _trinket_.

Message: 1011
<ce>  A guard spots you and begins to shout the alarm.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Stop! A thief! Everyone come quickly!"
<--->
<ce>  A concealed guard begins to shout the alarm.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Hey! Wait! Someone's stealing the evidence!"

Message:  1015
<ce>  The _trinket_ has broken apart under the force of the
<ce>  spell. No one's going to track you here, but you'll have
<ce>  to find your own way out.
<ce> 
<ce>  (Hint: You may be in a location that's impossible to escape from,)
<ce>  (like inside an enclosed cage or at the bottom of a chute. If so,)
<ce>  (make a save and try the console command "teleport" to get out.)

Message:  1020
<ce>  You have failed to steal the evidence for _dummy_'s trial.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of the Thieves Guild
 needs me to filch a confession and
 evidence statement about a guild
 member in the palace at ___pal_.
 I've got an escape plan to teleport
 using a _trinket_ they got me. I have to
 steal it within =2pal_ days, but after
 that I can take my time getting back
 to ___qgiver_.
