<ce>                There's a hot _gem_ being stored over
<ce>                    in ___res_, guarded by someone
<ce>               from the Fighters Guild. We need someone
<ce>                  smart enough to avoid fighting to
<ce>                     get it here in =timer_ days.
<ce>                        Think you can do that?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>              You just wanna be our errand kid forever?
<ce>                We won't always have easy stuff to do.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               I said avoid fighting, but to be honest,
<ce>               I don't really care. It's more for your benefit.
<ce>             If the Fighters Guild sends people after you,
<ce>          we're just gonna call it an independent action.
<ce>             If you'd just get in, steal it, and get out,
<ce>             they probably won't even recognize you.
<ce>                        Go look in _res_, ___res_.
<ce>                 I'll have =reward_ gold for
<ce>               you here if you're back in =timer_ days.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                    _questgiver_ told you to be in
<ce>                ___questgiver_ with the _gem_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             All right then. How'd you do it, by running
<ce>               fast or staying out of sight? Good work.
<ce>                         Here's your reward.

<ce>                          No! Someone help!

<ce>                      The Thieves Guild is here!

Message:  1021
<ce>                   This must be the guarded _gem_.
