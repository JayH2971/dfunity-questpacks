QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  One of our members is pulling in a real haul,
<ce>  making a lot of money for the guild.
<ce>  Problem is, the locals are starting to figure him
<ce>  out and they're starting to get suspicious.
<ce>  We need someone to take a fall for him,
<ce>  get framed so they let their guard back down.
<ce>  Your reputation in %crn's gonna take a hit,
<ce>  but we've got a good reward for you this time.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>  I'm telling you, you want this reward.
<ce>  I'll hold onto it for awhile,
<ce>  but you're missing out.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> Good. You won't regret this.
<ce> The town guard's got him figured out, that he's
<ce> going to hit _res_ next, in ___res_.
<ce> That's where you need to be.
<ce> Find something valuable in that house and take it.
<ce> You might get caught,
<ce> you'll probably get a bad rep, but that's gravy.
<ce> When I see you again,
<ce> I'll have your enchanted _reward_ here.
<ce> And it ain't no ordinary thing, it's just what a thief wants.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  Life's gonna be tough with a bad rep,
<ce>  I know. We've all been there.
<ce>  If you decide to head off someplace else,
<ce>  you might be doing yourself a favor.
<ce>  But an even bigger favor is taking this thing,
<ce>  your _reward_. Got an enchantment
<ce>  on it to unlock doors. Use it wisely,
<ce>  it's gonna wear out pretty fast.

Message: 1011
<ce>  A watchman catches you in the act.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Hey! We found %pg2! The thief of ___res_!"
<ce>  
<ce>  Looks like the plan is working out just fine.
