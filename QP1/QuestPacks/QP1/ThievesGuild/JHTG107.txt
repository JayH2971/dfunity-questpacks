QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                 Kidnapping means we need everything
<ce>              set up for the big payoff. The hostage is
<ce>                tied up, the family is desperate, the
<ce>                %t is clueless or paid off, and so on.
<ce>               But every once in a while we get a case
<ce>               like this one, where the family doesn't
<ce>                 actually believe us. Help us out by
<ce>                     showing them we're serious.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>               Well, something's gotta give eventually
<ce>               I guess. Hope we don't have to bury him.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                      The stubborn one is _fam_,
<ce>                  one of the wealthier folks over in
<ce>                  ___res_. Doesn't seem to fear the
<ce>               name "Thieves Guild," but %g1'll learn.
<ce>                  Take this finger over there if %g1
<ce>                 thinks %g1's too high and mighty for
<ce>                 a payment. That usually sends these
<ce>                 people over the edge. Get the money
<ce>                    back here in =timer_ days, and
<ce>                      try to be quiet about it.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                     _qgiver_ told you to get the
<ce>                ransom payment to ___qgiver_ by today.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>              Lemme open it up. Yep, looks about right.
<ce>               I'll have to weigh it to make sure, but
<ce>              it's looking good. I'll send the word now.
<ce>                            Have your cut.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
_fam_ seems awfully distraught about something.

Message:  1020
<ce>            Pathetic %ra, you make me sick. Why shouldn't
<ce>              I kill you now? I've already told the %t.
<ce>               In fact, they've probably already found
<ce>            %g2. Tell me, why should I give you anything?

Message:  1021
<ce>                         _fam_ looks sick as
<ce>                       %g1 inspects the finger.
<ce>
<ce>               "By %god. You can't be serious. You..."
<ce>
<ce>                Defeated, %g1 pulls a cloth sack from
<ce>               a cabinet and fills it with various gems
<ce>                 before throwing it to you. %g1 then
<ce>                    slumps down, shaking slightly.
<ce>                   You take your leave in silence.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 A ransom plot based in ___res_
 needs a morale boost. I need
 to talk to _fam_ and
 see if I can convince %g2
 to pay the fee. If not,
 _qgiver_ gave me a
 cut-off finger for motivation. I
 need to get the payment to the
 Thieves Guild in ___qgiver_
 in =timer_ days' time.
