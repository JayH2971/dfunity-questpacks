<ce> We need a good thief. Or maybe just a tough one.
<ce> There's a gem over in ___place_ that
<ce> belongs to some relative of the %t. We're paying
<ce> an enchanted =reward_ in exchange for bringing it
<ce> back in =timer_ days. You want in?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> I'll look for a good thief then.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> So here's the deal. It's off in _place_,
<ce> which to me is suspicious. Be ready for anything that
<ce> could happen. You're on your own 'til you get here.
<ce> You've got =timer_ days before that _gem_ has to
<ce> to be over here. Take care of yourself.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> _questgiver_ wanted the %t's family _gem_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> So tell me how it went. Yeah, you look like you've been
<ce> through a lot. I won't ask any more. Take your _reward_.

Message:  1020
<ce> So soon as you touch it, the _gem_ emits
<ce> a puff of dark smoke. You start to feel ill.
