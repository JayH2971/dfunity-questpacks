QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>         Yeah, I've got something for you. That is, for YOU.
<ce>            It ain't gonna be pretty, I can tell you that.
<ce>        But if you take it, the client's offering one of those
<ce>          artifacts, the powerful ones. That's how big this
<ce>                   thing is. Are you gonna take it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                       Well then, that's that.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>      Here. There's this bag here, and don't bother opening it.
<ce>      You can't and you don't wanna know what's inside. Now that
<ce>      it's in your hands, two things are gonna start to happen.
<ce>      One, you're gonna start to feel violently ill, and that's
<ce>       not gonna go away. Two, you're gonna start to see daedra
<ce>       coming for you. That's why this is for you specifically.
<ce>      For most people this is a suicide job, and maybe we should
<ce>          call it that. But this bag has to get to ___tav_.
<ce>           A contact named _gpers_ is gonna be in a tavern
<ce>               called _tav_ about =days_ days from now.

<ce>              Welcome, child. Give me the bag, quickly.
<ce>        No creature must know of its continued presence here.
<ce>         And now, before I slay you and your witnessing eyes,
<ce>               take this reward. It is a fair exchange.
<ce>                          Safe travels, %ra.

Message:  1010
<ce>           But really, let me just ask this. One last time.
<ce>     Are you sure you want to do this? You've only got one life,
<ce>                and I'd hate to see you throw it away.

Message:  1011
<ce>                All right then. Get marching, soldier.
<ce>                        Oblivion's on its way.

Message:  1012
<ce>          Sure, no hard feelings. Like I said, it's suicide.
<ce>           I'll tell the client it's not worth the trouble.

Message:  1015
<ce>          You could throw away the bag if you choose, though
<ce>       that would likely cause problems for the Thieves Guild.
<ce>                      Do you wish to abandon it?

Message:  1016
<ce>                         You discard the bag.

Message:  1020
<ce>               A deafening roar sounds in the distance.
