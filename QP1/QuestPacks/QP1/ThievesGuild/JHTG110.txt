QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>      We've got a request here for someone of your skill level.
<ce>           A sealed bag with some really important contents
<ce>         was stolen from one of our highest-ranking members.
<ce>    It's gonna be used for blackmail unless someone gets it back.
<ce>         We need someone quick, smart, and tough enough to go
<ce>            down into the cave and retrieve it before its
<ce>               alarm starts sounding. You in the mood?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>     Well, I guess the enchanted _item_ will go to someone else.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>        All right. No backing out now, 'cause I'm only sending
<ce>           in one person for it, and that's you. Look for a
<ce>               little tan bag somewhere in ___dungeon_.
<ce>        I expect it'll be well hidden but I really don't know.
<ce>          The big problem you have is the alarm system they
<ce>       rigged the place up with. If it knows a stranger's been
<ce>    inside for 4 hours, it'll start sounding and bad stuff's gonna
<ce>    start to happen. No idea what, but you'd better not find out.
<ce>    Take a step outside if you need to rest. Don't do it indoors.
<ce>       You'll only get four hours total, so use your time well.
<ce>          Come back here in =timer_ days' time and I'll have
<ce>              this enchanted _item_ for you as a reward.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>     _qgiver_ expected you to return with the sealed bag by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>    Well I'll be. Blackmail's tough business, but you're tougher.
<ce>      We'll find the slimy runt who set up our brother this way,
<ce>          don't worry. All that matters to you is the _item_
<ce>                     I promised you. Here it is.

Message:  1010
<ce>                    You remember _qgiver_'s words:
<ce>
<ce>              "If it knows a stranger's been inside for
<ce>         4 hours, it'll start sounding and bad stuff's gonna
<ce>    start to happen. No idea what, but you'd better not find out.
<ce>    Take a step outside if you need to rest. Don't do it indoors.
<ce>                  You'll only get four hours total."
<ce>
<ce>                      It's time to get started.

Message:  1011
<ce>        You've found the bag. However, you don't find anything
<ce>         related to the alarm on it. Looks like you'll still
<ce>                      need to hurry out of here.

Message:  1012
<ce>         A slight whistling noise begins to sound in the air.
<ce>     If you weren't listening for it, you probably wouldn't even
<ce>   notice it. In response, the walls around you begin to shift and
<ce>   take human form. Though you've faced greater danger in the past,
<ce>       this is going to be a major impediment to your mission.

Message:  1013
<ce>          Not even your best magicks can pry this bag open.
<ce>                 Its contents must be very sensitive.

 In exchange for some enchanted _item_,
 I'm off to ___dungeon_ to get a bag
 of incriminating evidence against a member of the
 Thieves Guild. I can only be inside for four hours
 before an alarm starts sounding. I need to have it
 and get back to ___qgiver_ in =timer_ days.
