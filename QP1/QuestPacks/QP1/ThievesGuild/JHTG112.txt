QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>        Got word of some treasure down in the inner depths of
<ce>           %crn that could use some plundering. Wanna bring
<ce>                it back here so we can split the loot?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>         See, that's why I don't give all the details first.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>           Deal. It's in ___dungeon_. You're gonna have to
<ce>         look for a bag somewhere down there. The thing's got
<ce>      a really good locking mechanism, so those hands are gonna
<ce>      be useless for it. Just bring it back here and we'll give
<ce>               you a share of the money we find inside.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>          Good work. Keep doing this and we'll all get rich.

Message:  1010
<ce>             Just as _qgiver_ said, this bag is magically
<ce>        sealed. No amount of lockpicking will get through it.

Message:  1011
<ce>       Your spell unseals the bag. There are several documents
<ce>      of historical and political value inside, which the guild
<ce>      could probably use to blackmail a few important people in
<ce>      the area. What matters to you is the =bigreward_ gold you
<ce>               find rustling around all the parchment.

Message:  1012
<ce>         Couldn't get through it, huh? Don't worry. It's easy
<ce>       for some of the guys we've got here. Just wait a minute.
<ce>
<ce>           Yep, let's see what's inside... Ooh, nice stuff.
<ce>         I bet most of this would be useless to someone like
<ce>       you, but the Spymaster's gonna have a field day with it.
<ce>                   The fence, too. Take your share.

Message:  1013
<ce>           The bag's open? That's odd. Spymaster said there
<ce>               was gonna be a really tough lock on it.
<ce>
<ce>       Let's see... No money. Too bad, but that's what happens
<ce>    sometimes. It's got a bunch of documents I think we'd be able
<ce>     to use. Maybe sell 'em to some aristocrat. Sorry you've got
<ce>   the short end of the stick here, but we said you'd get a share,
<ce>  and your share is zero. We'll still count this as a favor, though.
