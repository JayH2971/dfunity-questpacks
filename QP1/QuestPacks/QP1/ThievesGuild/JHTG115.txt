<ce>          One of the benefits of being in the Thieves Guild
<ce>    is knowing where money is in the city, free for the grabbing.
<ce>        There's a house here in ___qgiver_ that's got a couple
<ce>     hundred gold in it. If you're good at sneaking, you can try
<ce>    to nab it for yourself. Want me to reserve the house for you?
                                     <--->
<ce>         Every day here in ___qgiver_, people hide away their
<ce>    savings in their houses. Some do it good, others do it sloppy.
<ce>     We got a tip on a house that's carrying a few hundred gold.
<ce>       If you want, I can mark it down for you. Won't earn you
<ce>        any points with the guild, but you'll get some money.
<ce>                            You takin' it?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>         No loss. Can't be overfeeding in this city, anyway.
                                     <--->
<ce>           This one's gonna be gone next hour, I swear it.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>         All right then. It's called _house_, %di from here.
<ce>      I dunno how much is in there, but you're not gonna retire
<ce>               off of it. Likewise, it's not gonna take
<ce>       a master Khajiit to get in and out of there undetected.
<ce>     Low risk, low reward. I don't think you'll get more than two
<ce>            days before it's spent or moved, so hurry on.
<ce>        And remember that if you get caught, whoever tipped us
<ce>      off on the house is gonna suffer for it. Don't get caught.
                                     <--->
<ce>                       _house_ has your money,
<ce>                  off that way, %di. You've seen it.
<ce>         Can't be more than a couple hundred gold, but that's
<ce>           the nature of it. Won't nab much if you're just
<ce>             stealing from houses. But don't get caught.
<ce>            Whoever told us about that house would suffer
<ce>         for it. Money like that gets spent in a couple days,
<ce>             so don't dally on it. And don't get caught.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                        (STEALTH CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>          You know a little about sneaking, but not enough.
<ce>     Someone knows you're here, and they're shouting up a storm.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>     Looks like you're in the clear. The money is yours to spend.

QuestorPostFailure:  [1009]
Remember, you owe us for the money in _house_. Take some jobs and pay us back.

%qdt:
 The Thieves Guild tipped me off
 about a house here in ___qgiver_
 that should be holding a few hundred
 gold somewhere inside,
 called _house_.
 If I can find the money in the next
 couple of days, it's mine.

<ce>         You find the chest and see it has a very formidable
<ce>                lock on it. If you want what's inside,
<ce>             you're going to have to unlock it yourself.
<ce>                      Do you attempt to open it?
<ce>

<ce>
<ce>          Knowing you don't have much time, you get working.
<ce>        It doesn't take more than a few seconds before the lid
<ce>           flies open. You grab the contents for yourself.

<ce>
<ce>          Knowing you don't have much time, you get working.
<ce>      You dig in deep and trigger something you shouldn't have.
<ce>               A loud siren rings throughout the house.
<ce>                        You're in it deep now.

Message:  1014
<ce>    Looking at the lock, you start to second-guess your abilities.
<ce>            You can still get out without causing a major
<ce>      screw-up, you tell yourself. You leave the chest. No sense
<ce>       carrying around a big red flag if you can't get it open.

Message:  1015
<ce>             This is the right house. You've got to find
<ce>                     a chest somewhere inside it.
