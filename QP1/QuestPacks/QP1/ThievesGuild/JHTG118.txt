<ce>                 There's a kid here in town who needs
<ce>                 to get abducted and held for ransom.
<ce>            We need someone who's good with words and can
<ce>                  move from place to place quickly.
<ce>            Accept only if you meet those qualifications.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                Speech is real important for a thief.
<ce>                  I hope you get better at it, fast.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     All right. The kid's name is
<ce>              _kid_. Every day %g3 parents leave %g2 in
<ce>                  _tavern_ while they work, and then
<ce>             a relative comes and picks %g2 up later on.
<ce>               Whatever excuse you wanna come up with,
<ce>            that's your job, but you need to get this kid
<ce>                   out of the tavern and into _res_
<ce>             in town. That'll mean =reward_ gold for you.
<ce>                    Screw up, and you get nothing.
<ce>               We need to collect on this in 24 hours.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>                  24 hours have passed, and you have
<ce>                    not delivered _kid_ to _res_.
<ce>                        The scheme has failed.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                    When you enter the residence,
<ce>             a hooded figure takes _kid_ by the shoulder
<ce>                    and leads %g2 to another room.
<ce>           You wait for your payment, and then realize that
<ce>          a bag of gold has somehow been put into your hand.

Message:  1010
<ce>              The typical cacophany of _tavern_ assaults
<ce>         your ears as you enter. Loud laughter, cheering, and
<ce>          some snoring sound from within the patrons' rooms.

Message:  1011
<ce>         _kid_ looks at you distrustfully. "Who are you, and
<ce>            why are we leaving so early? We just got here.
<ce>         Where's my aunt?" You make up some explanations that
<ce>         the child naively accepts, and %g1 starts to follow.

Message:  1012
<ce>        You are spotted immediately after leaving the tavern.
<ce>         "Halt!" A member of the town guard runs over to you.
<ce>      "I've seen that child leave the tavern lots of times, but
<ce>         never with you. Who are you and what are you doing?"
<ce>
<ce>      Your mind races. Do you attempt to lie (yes) or surrender
<ce>                     the child to the guard (no)?
<ce>
<ce>               (SKILL CHECK: YES: Streetwise, difficulty very low)

Message:  1013
<ce>                       (SKILL CHECK SUCCEEDED)
<ce>
<ce>         "So %g3 aunt asked you to come for %g2 because she's
<ce>       injured? Well, all right then." He kneels down and asks
<ce>     _kid_, "Do you believe this %ra?" The child shrugs and says,
<ce>               "I guess. My aunt's a pretty smart lady.
<ce>      I'll have to see what's wrong with her when we get home."
<ce>
<ce>     "All right, get moving, you two. But I'll be watching you,"
<ce>                  the guard says, waving you along.

Message:  1014
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>       Your mind freezes up. You start to come up with a story,
<ce>           but your manner of telling it convinces no one.
<ce>         The child shrieks and runs away, and the town guard
<ce>                flees back a pace, shouting for help.

Message:  1015
<ce>                You surrender the child to the guard.
<ce>       He looks at you with some surprise, but can tell you're
<ce>      in over your head here. "Fine then. I'll just forget about
<ce>      this, and we'll make sure this young one gets home safe."
<ce>
<ce>              You step back and let the two of them go,
<ce>                 washing your hands of the incident.
