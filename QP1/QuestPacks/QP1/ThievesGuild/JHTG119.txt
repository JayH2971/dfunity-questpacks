QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>           Just got a request from one of our guild members
<ce>        out looking for treasure. Needs a top-tier lockpicker
<ce>            to help out with something that got uncovered
<ce>             down there. If it's really a black box like
<ce>            the message says it is, it's worth real money.
<ce>                  You good enough to take this one?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             Fair enough. We've got some people here who
<ce>                can crack a deadbolt in half a second.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>             Then it's yours. Hope you can live up to it.
<ce>        Look for _thief_ in ___dungeon_. We got %g3 messenger
<ce>       bird with a note that %g3's too afraid to open it up.
<ce>         Ugly-looking powder around the door frame, %g1 says.
<ce>          Smart people keep away from that unless they know
<ce>          what they're doing. The note said %g1's gonna wait
<ce>        =timer_ days more and then leave. Don't let %g2 down,
<ce>      or us, on this one. And keep the spoils for your trouble.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>         _thief_ has given up waiting for you in ___dungeon_.

<ce>                      You made the journey here.
<ce>        The Thieves Guild can't fault you for doing your job.

Message:  1010
<ce>               "Halt. Thieves Guild? Good. Here it is."
<ce>                 _thief_ shows you a large black box,
<ce>          made of oak and ebony. It can withstand incredible
<ce>           punishment, as evidenced by the numerous impacts
<ce>               %g1 has given it while waiting for you.
<ce>
<ce>            "If you can get this open, we split it 50-50.
<ce>           If you can't, I'm outta here. Make your choice.
<ce>             And no, magic is useless. I already tried."
<ce>
<ce>       Black boxes are legendary among thieves. To open one up
<ce>      is a major achievement. Are you sure you want to try this?
<ce>
<ce>              (SKILL CHECK: YES: Lockpicking, difficulty very high)

<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>
<ce>       You carefully, gently set to work on the lock mechanism.
<ce>          You know from experience that one of these things
<ce>            can hurt you much worse than you can hurt it.
<ce>     Minutes pass, and you listen carefully to the springs move.
<ce>          _thief_ sits down and rests %g3 head in %g3 hands.
<ce>           It takes much longer than an ordinary door bolt,
<ce>         but in the end, you conquer. Gold spills out of the
<ce>        box and onto the floor. You divide it into equal piles
<ce>                            on the ground.
<ce>
<ce>         "Good work. Hope you brought a wagon. I'm definitely
<ce>       not walking this stuff home." Pulling out a large sack,
<ce>        %g1 gathers the coins together and then casts a Recall
<ce>                    spell, disappearing from view.
<ce>                        The rest is all yours.

<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>                    You start to work on the lock,
<ce>                reaching in and feeling for the pins.
<ce>             You quickly find this box is unlike anything
<ce>            you've ever opened before. You hear a loud and
<ce>           angry snap from within the box, making it shake
<ce>                inside. Then with a loud boom, the top
<ce>        compartment flies off and purple powder scatters into
<ce>                   the air. _thief_ screams at you,
<ce>         "WORTHLESS CHILD OF A HORSE! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA--"
<ce>
<ce>           Then %g1 starts gagging and coughing, and flees.
<ce>           The purple dust goes everywhere, onto your bag,
<ce>                     your sinuses, and your skin.
<ce>              You swing your arms to get some fresh air,
<ce>                   coughing from the noxious agent.
<ce>             Finally, with another snap, the box locks up
<ce>         permanently. It refuses entry to any key whatsoever.
<ce>         Its contents are forever lost to you and all others.

Message:  1013
<ce>            "Cold feet? Disappointing, but you've got the
<ce>        sense to recognize danger. I thought this was gonna be
<ce>         a child's toy too, until I looked at it. Better not
<ce>              to mess around with it. I'll have to look
<ce>                       for someone myself now."
<ce>
<ce>            _thief_ casts an invisibility spell on the box
<ce>                      and departs with a salute.
