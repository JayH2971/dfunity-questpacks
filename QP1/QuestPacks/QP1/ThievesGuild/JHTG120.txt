QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>    Got a guild member here in town who managed to
<ce>  score big with a break-in. Stole a box with
<ce>  some really valuable stuff inside, apparently,
<ce>  but needs a locksmith to open it up.
<ce>  This ain't gonna be a world-class challenge,
<ce>  but you better know about picking hard locks
<ce>  if you're gonna take this one.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             Good. Don't pretend to be nothing you ain't.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>       Go to _tav_ and look for _thief_.
<ce>  We told %g2 not to bring the box here,
<ce>  just in case something goes wrong.
<ce>  We don't need no city guards marching in here.
<ce>  If you get it open, you'll get guild credit,
<ce>  just like for any other job. _thief_'s
<ce>  gonna pay the guild fee, so whatever %g1
<ce>  gives you is gonna be yours. Don't take more
<ce>  than a day to get there, %g1 can't wait forever.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>         _thief_ has given up waiting for you in _tav_.

<ce>        (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>  
<ce>   Your skills were made for times like these.
<ce>  You sit down in front of the box and get to work.
<ce>  There are a few surprises that try to worry you,
<ce>  but you deal with them and clear the deadbolt.
<ce>  _thief_ exhales loudly when the box opens.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Very nice. Lemme take a look...
<ce>  The money's in bundles, that's good.
<ce>  Let me take out the guild's share, and
<ce>  you get =gold_. And what's this?
<ce>  A couple of enchanted items.
<ce>  I'm taking mine, so you get the other one.
<ce>  Nice knowing you."
<ce>  
<ce>  _thief_ quickly bundles up %g3 share
<ce>  and hurries out the door.

Message:  1010
<ce>   "About time they got someone. This thing freaks me out,
<ce>  so you better know what you're doing. I'll step back
<ce>  and watch, just in case."
<ce>  
<ce>  The lock is well-built and ornate, but nothing out of the ordinary.
<ce>  It'd be a cinch for a mid-level thief, from the looks of it.
<ce>  You can still back out if you're unsure.
<ce>  Do you attempt to unlock the box?
<ce>
<ce>              (SKILL CHECK: YES: Lockpicking, difficulty medium)

<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>     You sit down in front of the box and get to work.
<ce>  You're surprised by what you feel inside the lock.
<ce>  Things aren't in their usual places, and you're
<ce>  getting resistance where you don't expect to.
<ce>  You get a bad feeling about this, and just as you're about
<ce>  to withdraw your pick, you hear a loud snap come from within the box.
<ce>  Steam starts shooting out of the top, and a loud whistling noise
<ce>  fills the tavern. You can't quiet it down.
<ce>  
<ce>  "MORON! THE GUARDS ARE GONNA HEAR THAT! RUN!!"
<ce>  
<ce>  _thief_ grabs the box and flees.
<ce>  Now you'll have to live with the consequences.

Message:  1013
<ce>            "Really? Oh well. I'm glad you're smart
<ce>  enough to back out when you know it's beyond you.
<ce>  Some of those morons in the guild would keep
<ce>  bashing a box like this 'til their wrist breaks.
<ce>  I'll tell _qgiver_ to send someone else. Later."
<ce>
<ce>            _thief_ takes the box to another corner
<ce>  of the tavern to avoid suspicion.
