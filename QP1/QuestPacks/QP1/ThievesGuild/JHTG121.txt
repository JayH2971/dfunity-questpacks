QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>  You know how to pick pockets, %pct?
<ce>  We got someone over at a tavern in town
<ce>  holding something they shouldn't.
<ce>  We need it in our hands by the end of the day.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>   Not a popular art. Shame on us as thieves.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  All right, the mark's in _tav_,
<ce>  off %di here in ___tav_.
<ce>  Look for a bloke with a scar on his chin,
<ce>  red hair. In one of his pockets he's got
<ce>  a piece of paper with some important information on it.
<ce>  What that is, you don't need to know.
<ce>  Get it here before one day's up.
<ce>  There's =gold_ gold riding on this.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>         The Thieves Guild needed you to steal and
<ce>  deliver the paper from the red-haired man by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  Here it is. I don't hear anyone shouting halt,
<ce>  so I'll assume the job was clean. Nice work.
<ce>  We could use more pickpockets like you.

QuestorPostSuccess:   [1008]
How're them fingers doing? Steal anything nice lately?

QuestorPostFailure:   [1009]
Yeah, our so-called pickpocket. Guild's gonna be a laughingstock at this rate.

Message:  1010
<ce>  As luck would have it, your mark is about to leave the tavern.
<ce>  He matches the description. If you're going to steal from him,
<ce>  this is your chance. Will you take it?
<ce>
<ce>              (SKILL CHECK: YES: Pickpocket, difficulty low)

Message:  1011
<ce>  The words on this paper shift around.
<ce>  You'd need some spell to read them.

Message:  1012
<ce>                         (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>  You wait until he passes before reaching into the back pocket
<ce>  of his coat. Not only is it empty, he notices your attempt.
<ce>  The man delivers you a swift backhand before calling for the guards
<ce>  and fleeing into the town.

Message:  1013
<ce>  You could get into real trouble doing something like this.
<ce>  You step aside and let the man leave the tavern.
<ce>  _qgiver_ may not be happy, but you feel better this way.

Message:  1014
<ce>                (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>  
<ce>  You know how to deal with this.
<ce>  You eye the man's pockets and casually bump into him.
<ce>  He's angry with the confrontation, but doesn't notice
<ce>  your theft. You apologize and he leaves in a huff.
