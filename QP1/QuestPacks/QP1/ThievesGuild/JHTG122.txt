<ce>  Some cad over in the Mages Guild's gone over the line,
<ce>  and we need to send a message. It involves stealing something
<ce>  from someone's coat without them noticing.
<ce>  If you're gonna take this one, make sure you're good at it.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>   Well, making wizards mad can be a bad idea.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  Bloke's name is _mage_. Hangs out in
<ce>  the Mages Guild here in ___magery_ most of the time.
<ce>  Go in during normal hours and look for him.
<ce>  Rumor has it he looks like some =mage_.
<ce>  Somewhere in his belongings is some enchanted _reward_.
<ce>  Grab it, make sure he doesn't see you,
<ce>  and keep it for your reward. The Thieves Guild
<ce>  will make sure he knows why it's gone.
<ce>  Get it done before this time tomorrow.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>  You had to steal the enchanted _reward_
<ce>  from the mage in ___magery_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>  (SKILL CHECK PASSED)
<ce>  
<ce>  Feigning ignorance, you ask where the exit is.
<ce>  _mage_ looks distraught, and points
<ce>  down the hall. He is distracted long enough
<ce>  for you to steal the _reward_.
<ce>  You thank him and he returns to his studies.
<ce>  
<ce>  The Thieves Guild comes out on top today.

QuestorPostSuccess:   [1008]
Say hi to the Mages Guild for me next time you're over there.

QuestorPostFailure:   [1009]
You signed up to be a pickpocket and failed. That's on you.

Message:  1010
<ce>  _mage_, the =mage_, is in here somewhere.

Message:  1011
<ce>  Before you can get the jump on _mage_,
<ce>  he turns and gazes at you.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Yes? Can I help you?"
<ce>  
<ce>  With his attention on you, you won't have
<ce>  an easy time stealing the _reward_.
<ce>  But if you're going to do it, now's your chance.
<ce>  Will you attempt it?
<ce>
<ce>              (SKILL CHECK: YES: Pickpocket, difficulty medium)

Message:  1012
<ce>              (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>  Knowing he has the _reward_ is one thing,
<ce>  but actually making the theft is another.
<ce>  You stall for time and make _mage_ suspicious.
<ce>  Soon he's teleporting to a safe location,
<ce>  while guardians appear nearby.

Message:  1013
<ce>  This is just a little too much pressure for now.
<ce>  You ignore him and leave this task behind.
