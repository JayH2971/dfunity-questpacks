QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>    We need someone experienced, mature, and sensible to
<ce>    help out two very idiotic recruits to the guild.
<ce>    They found something they probably should've left alone,
<ce>    and I think it's dangerous. There's a real risk
<ce>    to this one, I'm warning you.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>    They might die. Then again, I might not care.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>    They got a few days' lead on you, headed to ___dung_.
<ce>    If you hurry, you might catch up to them.
<ce>    You're looking for _pers_,
<ce>    the only =pers_ you're gonna find down there,
<ce>    and his friend Viljas.
<ce>    They found a magical skull of some kind, with some
<ce>    real genuine powers to it. I really want
<ce>    it to end up in more seasoned hands than theirs.
<ce>    If at all possible, get it from them.
<ce>    I don't care if you give it to the
<ce>    guild or hold on to it for yourself,
<ce>    I just don't want them having it.
<ce>    If you can't do that, then whatever.
<ce>    Meet me here again in =timer_ days
<ce>    so I can be at peace.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>    _qgiver_ wanted you
<ce>    to report on the enchanted skull by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>    They got away with it? By %god.
<ce>    No, I don't blame you, not if what you're telling me is true.
<ce>    They're gonna be mass murderers at this rate.
<ce>    Maybe they already are.
<ce>    I'll tell the Mages Guild, or the %t, or someone.
<ce>    I don't know. Here, take this and let me
<ce>    figure out what I'm gonna do. This is bad.

Message:  1011
<ce>    "Hey! Oh, wow! You startled me! Thieves Guild?
<ce>    Good, good, good, good! Oh, %oth, I've got this
<ce>    skull in my hands and it's getting warm. I'm just about--"
<ce>    
<ce>    _pers_ is interrupted by a man,
<ce>    shouting and rapidly approaching. He yells,
<ce>    
<ce>    "Bad news! Bad news bad news bad news, they've found us!
<ce>    The people looking for that skull, they're almost here!
<ce>    They're right on our tail, they're gonna kill us!"
<ce>    
<ce>    _pers_ shouts back, "Viljas! You idiot, you led them to us?!"
<ce>    
<ce>    Viljas answers, "They already knew! They know about the skull!
<ce>    We can't hide it anymore! We're dead! We're all dead!"
<ce>    Then he asks you, "Who are you?"
<ce>    
<ce>    "Our savior, that's who," _pers_ answers. He hands the skull
<ce>    to Viljas and says, "Hey, neither of us are meant for fighting,
<ce>    so you're gonna keep us safe, okay? I know you don't know what's going on,
<ce>    but please, just fend them off until I say, okay? Please? Please?"
<ce>    
<ce>    Even as he speaks, you hear shouting and many plated boots beating the floor.
<ce>    There's no hiding now. The battle is almost upon you.
<ce>    
<ce>    "One thing, we need to stay underground until it's ready," Viljas mentions.
<ce>    "This thing's going to be useless otherwise. Just keep us safe for a little
<ce>    bit. It'll be worth it, okay?!"

Message:  1012
<ce>  Viljas shouts in pain as the skull gets searingly hot.
<ce>  He holds on tight, keeping it away from your many foes.

Message:  1013
<ce>  "AHH! I can't take it anymore!!" Viljas screams.
<ce>  The skull glows brightly, and then shoots out a force wave.

Message:  1014
<ce>  "VILJAS!! Do that again!" _pers_ screams.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Calm your mouth, this thing hurts like blazes!!" Viljas yells back.
<ce>  The skull begins to glow again.

Message:  1015
<ce>  All your foes are dead. Your two companions pant heavily, exhausted from
<ce>  the tumult of battle. Then they give each other a high-five.
<ce>  "HA HA! Amazing stuff! What a story that was!"
<ce>  They laugh and celebrate as Viljas puts the skull away.
<ce>  Then he starts running. Before you can catch him,
<ce>  _pers_ checks you with a shoulder tackle, sending you to the ground.
<ce>  By the time you recover your footing, they're both long gone.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Finders keepers, dumb %ra!" Viljas' voice echoes from afar.
<ce>  
<ce>  This will be quite the tale to tell _qgiver_.

Message:  1016
<ce>  _pers_ and Viljas' jaws drop with disbelief.
<ce>  They begin to yell at you.
<ce>  "IDIOT! We told you to stay underground until this thing was ready!
<ce>  Now it's useless!" They throw the skull at the ground, shattering it.
<ce>  They then stomp off without further discussion.

Message:  1017
<ce>  Viljas yells as the skull shoots out another force wave.

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 _qgiver_ of ___qgiver_ sent me to
 ___dung_ to find a pair of
 guild newcomers. They found
 something dangerous, and
 shouldn't be left alone with it.
 If I can, I need to get it from them
 and deliver it to _qgiver_,
 or at least tell %g2 about it
 within =timer_ days' time.

Message:  1031
%qdt:
 The two fools are holding an enchanted skull
 with some kind of power. We're being pursued by
 an armed band, and I have to keep us safe
 by one means or another until the skull
 is "ready." However, we can't leave
 ___dung_ until that happens.
