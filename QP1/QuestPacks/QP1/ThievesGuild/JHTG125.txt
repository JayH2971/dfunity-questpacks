<ce>  Got any heat on you, %pct? Anyone out to get you, or
<ce>  a mercenary wanting your head? If you do, don't take this next job.
<ce>  It'll only be dangerous if you're wanted... or if you melt
<ce>  under the sunlight or something. Otherwise, it's a free
<ce>  pile of gold for you. Want to do a simple delivery?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>    Fine. Someone's gonna get rich from this.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>  Here. Take this tome. And don't tell me I didn't warn you.
<ce>  Until you hand it off to _person_ in ___place_,
<ce>  you're gonna feel real bad. That's part of the risk,
<ce>  but I'm sure =reward_ gold pieces is gonna wipe that frown
<ce>  right off your face. Once this is over, anyway.
<ce>  Get it over there before =timer_ days are up,
<ce>  or else that book's gonna burn right up on you.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>   _person_ expected the tome by now.

QuestComplete:   [1004]
<ce>  %oth, I wished I never had to handle one of these.
<ce>  I've got a long night ahead of me. Money? Fine.
<ce>  Take this. Leave me alone, I'm about to have a really bad headache.
