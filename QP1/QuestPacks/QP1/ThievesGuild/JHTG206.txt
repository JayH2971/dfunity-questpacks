QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> There's a big reward being offered
<ce> for research notes by some wizard
<ce> named _dummy_. I guess
<ce> it's 'cause %g1's a member of the
<ce> Mages Guild. If you're not worried
<ce> about making enemies with them, you
<ce> can head over to ___res_
<ce> and bring some papers back here.

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Don't want =reward_ gold? Oh well.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> I don't know how long there's gonna be
<ce> a market for this particular scholar's work,
<ce> so get back here by, say, =timer_ days from now.
<ce> I'll have your cut here. I don't think the
<ce> place is guarded, so just find it and
<ce> come on back. Oh yeah, it's in a place
<ce> called _res_ in ___res_.
<ce> Almost forgot to mention that.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> _questgiver_ wanted you
<ce> to deliver the notes by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Looks like the real deal. Not like
<ce> I could tell anyway. Here's your cut.
