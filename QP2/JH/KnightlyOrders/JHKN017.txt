QRC:

QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce> We have a problem with scoundrels consorting about
<ce> a forlorn graveyard. Passing townspeople have mentioned
<ce> numerous incidents of small groups of armed people entering,
<ce> leaving, camping, and so on, all without noble intent.
<ce> Will you protect the sanctity of the resting place?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce> Ah, but if they were your own, perhaps you would feel differently.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce> You are tasked with guarding ___graveyard_ here
<ce> in %crn. As this is a frequent problem, I presume
<ce> you can stop by any time and start to apply a
<ce> solution. It shouldn't take multiple weeks but I do
<ce> expect you'll be there for awhile. Perhaps you may
<ce> take a book you'd like to read. From this day an edict
<ce> will go forth to keep away from the grounds, so anyone
<ce> who enters will be subject to your punishment.
<ce> Exact a judgment on all who appear. Return to me when
<ce> you have left a clear message. %god watch over
<ce> you while you guard the deceased.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce> 

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce> Welcome back, good %pct. Fine work. I trust in your judgment
<ce> and dedication. We ordinarily do not pass around rewards in
<ce> this order, but I supposed your noble sacrifice at least
<ce> merited a little material compensation. Take it and feel pride
<ce> in defending the defenseless.

Message: 1019
<ce> If this site is ___graveyard_,
<ce> sooner or later the criminals will arrive.

Message:  1020
<ce> Presumably this is enough bodies to send a message. 

Message:  1040
%qdt:
 ___graveyard_ in
 %crn has been desecrated
 by disreputable people sufficient
 to merit my standing watch.
 I am authorized to fight off any
 who enter it until I have made it
 clear that the grounds are to be left
 alone. I may then return to
 _questgiver_ in ___questgiver_
 to report my deed.
