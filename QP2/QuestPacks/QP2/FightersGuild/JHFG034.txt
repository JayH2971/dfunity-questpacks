QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>          So it turns out there are two kinds of atronachs.
<ce>           One's the kind that comes from the great beyond,
<ce>               puppets of daedra and things like that.
<ce>            Then the Mages Guild studied them and started
<ce>                  making copies of them as servants.
<ce>          We need someone to hunt down a real fire atronach
<ce>               from Oblivion itself. That interest you?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                         It was worth a shot.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>           It's not a major threat, but the real problem is
<ce>            that it's in a palace. Head over to ___place_
<ce>          and find it inside. Kill it and come back here for
<ce>                your =reward_ gold pieces. As long as
<ce>            you kill it in =timer_ days, you can take your
<ce>                          time coming back.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>         You needed to slay the atronach in ___place_ by now.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>           Not too tough, right %pcf? Maybe for some folks,
<ce>                   but not for the Fighters Guild.

Message:  1010
%qdt:
 The Fighters Guild of
 ___qgiver_ has sent me to
 ___place_ to slay a fire atronach
 in _place_ within =timer_ days.
 I can then return for my reward any time.

Message:  1011
<ce>          The blistering heat in the room starts to die down
<ce>          as the atronach ceases moving. Your work is done.

Message:  1012
<ce>                 (ATTRIBUTE CHECK FAILED: ENDURANCE)
<ce>
<ce>        This atronach has clearly come straight from Oblivion.
<ce>             Fiery tendrils reach out and rake your skin,
<ce>                    causing you significant pain.
