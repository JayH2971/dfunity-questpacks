<ce>     If you have a few hours to kill, maybe you can help me out.
<ce>         I have a pet bear that needs to go for a walk, but I
<ce>        sprained my ankle. Could you do it for =reward_ gold?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                My poor bear. Gonna get fat, you know?
                                     <--->
<ce>                            But he's tame!

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                     "Thanks! I'll call for him."
<ce>
<ce>           The bear trundles in soon after and rubs against
<ce>               his owner's leg. _questgiver_ gives you
<ce>          a leash and shows you how to pull the bear around.
<ce>
<ce>                 "Ya wanna take him over to _tavern_?
<ce>            It's a good walk, not too far. That's what we
<ce>              usually do. And if my bear dies, by %god,
<ce>              I will make you pay. Don't take too long,
<ce>              you hear? Bears are lovable but you should
<ce>               bring him back in four hours, no later."

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>               The bear rumbles. With a burst of speed
<ce>             he takes off and breaks free of your grasp.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>          How was it? You both have a good time? People can
<ce>         be mean to a pet bear, but a few arrows through the
<ce>       lungs is how I solve it. You did good. Take this money.

RumorsDuringQuest:  [1005]
Sorry, is that a bear following you?
<--->
Keep that bear away.

QuestorPostFailure:  [1009]
Bear killer.

Message:  1010
<ce>                  This is _tavern_, as _questgiver_
<ce>       asked you. The bear sniffs the various familiar objects
<ce>                 nearby and lumbers back over to you.

Message:  1011
<ce>           "Hey! A bear! A bear's here! I'm gonna kill it!"
<ce>
<ce>               One patron, feeling particularly heroic,
<ce>                     tries to slay the pet bear.

Message:  1012
<ce>      The bear roars at something nearby. You see a pair of rats
<ce>        scurrying about, and the bear's rumbling has startled
<ce>                          them into action.

Message:  1013
<ce>           The bear starts moving about rather haphazardly.
<ce>          You see a small gash on one of its paws -- perhaps
<ce>           it was diseased by the rats. You notice a small
<ce>                     note tucked into its collar.
<ce>
<ce>                 "If sick, please deliver to _priest_
<ce>                     at _temple_, ___questgiver_"

Message:  1014
<ce>                      I see _questgiver_'s bear.
<ce>                 Hello bear. Yes, I'll charge %g2 for
<ce>             the service. Let me cast the spell... Done.
<ce>               %god watch over you and your new master,
<ce>                            furry friend.

Message:  1015
<ce>               The bear slumps over and ceases moving.
<ce>                 It appears the disease acted faster
<ce>                          than you expected.

Message:  1016
<ce>               "Hey you! Idiot! You idiot! Stupid %ra!"
<ce>
<ce>                     Someone is calling for you.
<ce>
<ce>                "That bear was our pet! You killed it!
<ce>                            You die now!"

Message:  1017
<ce>            The bear suddenly gets startled by some noise
<ce>             in the distance. You struggle to hold on to
<ce>           the leash, but he breaks free. In his confusion,
<ce>                       he tries to attack you.

Message:  1018
<ce>           Slowly coming to his senses, the bear calms down
<ce>           and lies on the floor. You cautiously attach the
<ce>               leash to him once more. He pretends that
<ce>                        nothing ever happened.

Message:  1019
<ce>          The ranger manages to get in a shot while the bear
<ce>          is separated from you. He only manages to get out
<ce>             an agonized roar before he ceases breathing.
<ce>
<ce>                           "Yes! Got 'im!"

Message:  1020
<ce>              My bear looks sick. There's a note in his
<ce>                   collar that says to take him to
<ce>                        _temple_. Be a pal and
<ce>               do that, will you? My ankle's sprained.
