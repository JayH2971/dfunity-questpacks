QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>                  We have reports concerning a shop
<ce>                        in town, _shop_, of a
<ce>                tragic kind. For the past several days
<ce>              the town guard has hauled corpses of human
<ce>              beings out, all slain in the most gruesome
<ce>               fashion. They have no evidence as to who
<ce>              might be behind the slayings, but we here
<ce>                have some suspicions in mind. Will you
<ce>               be our agent in resolving these murders?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>                 Of course. ___questgiver_ hasn't had
<ce>                enough havoc and chaos yet, after all.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>               Brave, %pcf, but you will need more than
<ce>           bravery alone to match this foe. Each emaciated
<ce>          corpse has been slain in a truly horrific manner,
<ce>           but we can pick out some details from each one.
<ce>           The blood is too profusely spilt for it to be a
<ce>          vampire. The kills are done silently, precluding a
<ce>            lycanthrope culprit. And merely looking at the
<ce>              dead bodies erases any thought of a human
<ce>              at work. No, this is a powerful enemy that
<ce>           we cannot detect. Do your work to search for the
<ce>                  guilty party, and then go to _res_
<ce>                  to find _priest_, a utility mage.
<ce>           Confront the suspect together and do your duty.
<ce>           I cannot give you more than two days to do this.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>             No matter what progress you might have made
<ce>                  to solve the murders, _questgiver_
<ce>              will not accept how long it has taken you.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>             To think such a powerful foe can infiltrate
<ce>             this city and slay according to its will and
<ce>              pleasure is troubling. But you have proven
<ce>                yourself a knight of the first class.

Message:  1020
<ce>                    Do you have need of me, %pcf?
<ce>                 Find someone you consider suspicious
<ce>                 and come for me again. I cannot risk
<ce>                    being seen in public for long.

Message:  1021
<ce>                And what do you ask of me, beast? Will
<ce>             you not leave me alone? I told those guards
<ce>                 to give me peace and play out their
<ce>             investigation elsewhere. Now leave, lest my
<ce>             pocket knife find its way into some part of
<ce>               you, and your murderer find you at last.

Message:  1022
<ce>                  Ah, welcome, %pcf. Have you found
<ce>             someone to investigate? I can't be outdoors
<ce>              for long, as someone like myself has many
<ce>              foes. Let us hurry and see this person you
<ce>            speak of, and get to the truth of the matter.

Message:  1023
<ce>                       _culp_'s eyes flash red
<ce>                     as the two of you draw near.
<ce>
<ce>                   "I said leave me in peace! Leave
<ce>                    this instant, I command you!"
<ce>
<ce>                   _priest_ begins chanting without
<ce>           hesitation, bringing into effect an incantation
<ce>             to dispel magicka. In moments the air around
<ce>                      _culp_ begins to waver and
<ce>            shimmer, until you find yourself face to face
<ce>                   with an enraged and inhuman foe.

Message:  1024
<ce>                  _priest_ nearly collapses from the
<ce>              effort expended. Apparently %g1 is just as
<ce>              unsuited for powerful magical defenses as
<ce>              for combat. Eventually %g1 speaks to you.
<ce>
<ce>          "Well, our mystery is solved. The city guard will
<ce>            soon be questioning the store's owner to find
<ce>           out the connections, history, and so on of this
<ce>            entire ordeal. I'll make it out on my own once
<ce>              I can walk. Head back to the garrison and
<ce>                       report on our success."

Message:  1030
%qdt:
 I must look for a murderer
 here in ___questgiver_, based
 around _shop_. Once I
 have a reasonable suspicion, I should
 look for _priest_, hiding inside
 _res_, for help in
 unmasking the foe. I have two days.

Message:  1040
<ce>            _culp_'s eyes fill with terror at the sight of
<ce>           _priest_, who grins victoriously. After pushing
<ce>          you aside, %g1 shouts an incantation and exclaims,
<ce>
<ce>            "Lo, the mighty =dae1_ is mine! See now, %ra!
<ce>             My patience with those childish knights has
<ce>              been well rewarded. My new pet and I shall
<ce>                        become lords of %crn!"
<ce>
<ce>               _culp_'s illusion fades away and reveals
<ce>                        the daedra behind it.
<ce>              Now you must fight it and its new master.
<ce>               It appears _questgiver_ should check %g3
<ce>         references on these people before recommending them.

Message:  1041
<ce>             Without your intervention, _priest_ is free
<ce>               to attempt spells of greater magnitude.
<ce>        You hear a teleportation spell, and the inside of the
<ce>        building goes quiet. You have failed to bring justice
<ce>                      to ___res_'s foe this day.

Message:  1042
<ce>           Whatever _priest_'s reasons for turning against
<ce>          you, the problem has been solved. Both the daedra
<ce>               and the would-be master have been slain.
<ce>                It is time to report to _questgiver_.

Message:  1043
<ce>                          Your report, %pct.
<ce>
<ce>             My word, to think that _priest_ would betray
<ce>       us for the chance to enslave a daedra. Could the monster
<ce>       have tempted %g2 in some ethereal way to help it escape?
<ce>           Or was this something %g1 had planned time ago?
<ce>             In either case, your work has been stellar.
