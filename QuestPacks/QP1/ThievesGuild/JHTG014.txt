QuestorOffer:  [1000]
<ce>            Got a bit of a territory war that'll break out
<ce>              near a temple here in %reg. The Wharf Rats
<ce>        are getting brave again, and we need some strong arms
<ce>             for fighting. You gonna lend us yours, %pcf?

RefuseQuest:  [1001]
<ce>             The more we control, the more we all profit.
<ce>                        Think about it, %pct.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 Yeah, why would I ask for your arms
<ce>                      if you don't have a brain?

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                    Head to ___templehome_. That's
<ce>            %di from here. A bit of a trek. We've already
<ce>       got some hired men waiting for the fight, so the thing's
<ce>            gonna break out any time. Hurry over there and
<ce>       help us win this. We can't count on dark arts or none of
<ce>       that Dark Brotherhood business, so take every advantage
<ce>        you can get. Just don't go killing any guards, right?
<ce>          You do that, the blood's on your hands. Get going.

QuestFail:  [1003]
<ce>         Thieves aren't known for their bravery, but running
<ce>    from this battle will give you a particularly bad reputation.

QuestComplete:  [1004]
<ce>                The battle is won. Your allies merely
<ce>                 give each other congratulatory nods
<ce>                 before fading away into the shadows.
<ce>             The Thieves Guild's pay is enough for them,
<ce>                  and the Wharf Rats' loot is yours.

RumorsPostSuccess:  [1007]
The Thieves Guild are a ferocious bunch.

QuestorPostSuccess:  [1008]
The Wharf Rats show up again, I'll tell you about it.

Message:  1010
<ce>         Your allies, a hired band of barbarians, notice your
<ce>                    arrival in ___templehome_ and
<ce>           give you a sign to lay low. They've counted out
<ce>              six foes, a mix of rogues and spellswords.
<ce>
<ce>           The Wharf Rats soon notice your group's movement
<ce>               and rush to meet you. The battle is on.

Message:  1011
<ce>                    One of your allies has fallen.
<ce>          The enemy cheers, rallied by their small victory.
