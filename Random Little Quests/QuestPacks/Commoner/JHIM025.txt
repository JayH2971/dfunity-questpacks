<ce>                   Hail, %ra. Have time for a game?
<ce>         It's very simple. You pay 100 gold, non-refundable,
<ce>          and we flip a coin. If heads is up, I pay you 200.
<ce>                 If heads is down, I keep your money.
<ce>          You can keep doubling as long as you get heads up,
<ce>           but if you ever get a heads down, I take it all.
<ce>                     Want to put down a hundred?
