<ce>  You are led a short ways to the home
<ce>  of this simple peasant. The
<ce>  lumber poses no great difficulty
<ce>  to someone of your strength.
<ce>  It takes a few hours, but you manage to
<ce>  fill an entire wagon with chopped wood,
<ce>  enough to last several weeks.
<ce>  
<ce>  "You're awfully kind to do this for me.
<ce>  I'm sure this gold won't compensate you.
<ce>  Maybe %god will in my place.
<ce>  May %monn be kind to you."

<ce>                 A weary, elderly peasant opportunes
<ce>             people in the area for help with something.
<ce>              He then approaches you, and asks for your
<ce>                        help in a raspy voice.
<ce>
<ce>              "I'm sorry to bother you %ra, but I've no
<ce>              one else to ask. I sent my children off to
<ce>            labor for the season, and have run out of wood
<ce>            for my stove at home. The nights get so cold.
<ce>                 I'm too old to chop the wood myself.
<ce>             If you've got a strong arm and a few hours,
<ce>                would you be able to chop some for me?
<ce>                        I'll pay you, honest."

<ce>              and my family has forgotten all about me.
<ce>                All I want is some wood for the stove.
<ce>              I get so cold at night I can't sleep, and
<ce>                    I can't split the wood myself.

<ce>  The peasant's voice trembles.
<ce>  
<ce>  "Oh... Oh, I'm sure I'll find someone,
<ce>  don't you worry. %god bless your travels."

Message:  1012
<ce>  You take the hand axe and follow a short ways
<ce>  to the peasant's home. You try and try to split
<ce>  the wood, but you simply aren't strong enough
<ce>  for the task. The elderly peasant, feeling sorry for
<ce>  you, excuses you and thanks you for the attempt.
