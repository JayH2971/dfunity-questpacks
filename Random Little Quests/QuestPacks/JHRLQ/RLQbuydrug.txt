<ce>              You and the vendor silently make the exchange,

<ce>         A sharp-looking fellow, taking advantage of the fog,
<ce>             gestures at you with a small bag of powder.
<ce>             He silently mouths the word "_weapon_," asking
<ce>              for 50 gold. It looks like you'd be buying
<ce>                    a single dose for that price.
<ce>                          Take up his offer?

<ce>            The vendor hurries away into the fog,
<ce>                  and you lose sight of him.

Message:  1014
<ce>         You search your belongings but do not find 50 gold.
<ce>                 The merchant disappears into the fog
<ce>                  when he sees no money forthcoming.
