<ce>           After casting a spell to count your money for him,
<ce>             the frazzled wizard hands you the _item_ and
<ce>                  stumbles off into another direction.

Message:  1011
<ce>           A robed wizard with a rather confused demeanor bumbles
<ce>            about nearby. His distance from reality seems
<ce>         to vary with every passing moment. He stumbles close
<ce>          enough to focus his eyes on you, and then speaks.
<ce>
<ce>           "%hnr, I have a fine _item_ here, enchanted with
<ce>       powerful magicks. I can't remember what the enchantment
<ce>         is, or I'd be selling it for a lot more. For just 750
<ce>             gold pieces, it's all yours for the taking."
<ce>
<ce>                Do you purchase the magic _item_?

<ce>                 The wizard stumbles away as you hear
<ce>                  thunder claps in the distance.

<ce>             You try to gather up 750 gold pieces to give
<ce>              to him, but you do not have enough on hand.
<ce>           When you look back up toward the wizard, he is gone.
