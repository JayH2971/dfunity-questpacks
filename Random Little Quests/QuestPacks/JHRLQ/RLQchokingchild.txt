<ce>  You may not be Tamriel's foremost expert on blocked
<ce>  airways, but you know enough medicine to work out
<ce>  a solution. You grab the child from his mother and
<ce>  inspect his mouth, trying to dislodge anything
<ce>  that may be readily visible. You then press
<ce>  hard on the abdomen, expulsing the air that was
<ce>  inside his lungs. A small, heavily gnawed object flies
<ce>  out of his mouth and through the air. The boy's normal
<ce>  breathing resumes, much to the relief of everyone present.
<ce>  The mother sheepishly admits she doesn't have much
<ce>  of a compensation to offer, but then pulls a book
<ce>  out of her pack to pay you.

<ce>  A nearby woman cries out in a shrill tone.
<ce>  Her young child is choking and they need a physician.
<ce>  Will you try?

Message:  1011
<ce>  You refuse to intervene. Thankfully, it doesn't take
<ce>  long for someone qualified to step up and resolve
<ce>  the problem, earning the mother's profuse thanks.
<--->
<ce>  You refuse to intervene. She calls out again and again,
<ce>  and then passes by in a flurry. You see the boy's face
<ce>  turning blue before they disappear from sight.

<ce>          You confidently step forward and grab the boy, and
<ce>       then begin beating his back and neck to try to dislodge
<ce>      whatever is stuck within. The mother watches in horror and
<ce>    grabs him back after a few moments. The last you see of them,
<ce>          the blue-faced child is dragged out into the rain,
<ce>                 hopefully to find someone qualified.
<ce>
<ce>            An onlooker glares at you and shouts,
<ce>        "If you're not qualified, don't waste the lady's time!
<ce>                     %oth!"
