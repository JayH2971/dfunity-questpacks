<ce>               Shouts for help sound nearby. It seems an
<ce>           escaped atronach, feeding off the sun's warm rays,
<ce>        has lost control and is attacking townspeople.
<ce>                    Will you try to stop it?


Message:  1011
<ce>                You call for the atronach's attention.
<ce>              It shambles toward you, ready for battle.
<ce>             Nearby villagers stand back and watch the
<ce>                            duel with awe.

Message:  1012
<ce>            You hear cheering and applause as you destroy
<ce>        the creature. A few people nearby, including a member
<ce>             of the city watch, thank you for your help.

Message:  1013
<ce>          The city guard hurry to strike the creature down,
<ce>                and the townspeople resume their activities.
