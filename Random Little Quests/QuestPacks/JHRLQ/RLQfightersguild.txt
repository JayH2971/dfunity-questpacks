<ce>  "Then let me present you with this weapon.
<ce>  Your kind do incalculable good here in
<ce>  %crn. You would fare better with it than I.
<ce>  Farewell."
<ce>  
<ce>  The hooded figure bows and departs.

<ce>  "Hold it!"
<ce>  
<ce>  A shrill voice calls out to you. You turn around and see
<ce>  an hooded figure staring at you amid the pouring rain.
<ce>  
<ce>  "You, %ra! Are you one of those Fighters Guild people?"

Message:  1011
<ce>  "Worthless pieces of garbage! I was evicted from my
<ce>  home because you people couldn't even clean out the bats!
<ce>  Take this!"
<ce>  
<ce>  Whatever happened, you are now the target of
<ce>  this person's rage.
<--->
<ce>  "Ha, great! Another one down on the way home, what luck!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The assassin pulls out a knife and prepares for battle.
<--->
<ce>  "Filthy money-lovers! Prepare to die!"
<ce>  
<ce>  The hooded figure unsheathes a blade.

Message:  1012
<ce>  "I just wanted to thank you for getting that harpy
<ce>  out of _place_. Terrifying event, that was.
<ce>  You people are admirable. Safe journeys,
<ce>  may %god be with you."
<ce>  
<ce>  She leaves you alone. Whoever killed that harpy
<ce>  is earning quite a reputation.
<--->
<ce>  "Finally! I never got to thank you for killing those
<ce>  rats in _place_. I can't believe the town guard
<ce>  leaves us to fend them off. You people are
<ce>  a wonderful alternative."
<ce>  
<ce>  You're not sure this has anything to do with you,
<ce>  but you accept the thanks on the Fighters Guild's
<ce>  behalf and continue on.

Message:  1013
<ce>  "Ah, appearances deceive. Very well, off I go."
<ce>  
<ce>  The hooded figure then departs.
<--->
<ce>  "Are you sure? Could've sworn I heard about you
<ce>  in the guild hall recently."
<ce>  
<ce>  Though perplexed, the figure heads off.
