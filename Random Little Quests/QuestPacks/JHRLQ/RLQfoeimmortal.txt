<ce>  The barbarian falls. It looks like no one lives forever, after all.

Message:  1010
<ce>           You hear someone roaring under the shining sun.
<ce>                  A barbarian shouts to the people,
<ce>
<ce>     "Hahaha! I am an avatar of the gods! No one can defeat me!"
<ce>
<ce>      The fighter then begins swinging an axe around recklessly,
<ce>      trying to impress the villagers. People look worried that
<ce>  this may turn dangerous. Do you try to stop the barbarian?

Message:  1011
<ce>          You call for the mad fighter to stop, and only earn
<ce>        wrath in return. Marching at you, the berserker shouts,
<ce>               "Should've left well enough alone, %ra!
<ce>                      I can't be beaten!!"

Message:  1012
<ce>         You stay back and watch as members of the town guard
<ce>        work together to subdue the assailant. It takes a lot
<ce>             of bodies and some spellcasters as support,
<ce>  but they manage to arrest him. This fellow was clearly powerful.
