<ce>    Hoping no one spies you through the fog,
<ce>  you quickly reach down and grab the bag.

Message:  1010
<ce>      In your path, a small sack of gold lies on the ground.
<ce>  You see no name on it, nor does anyone around seem
<ce>  to be guarding it. It's too conspicuous to be
<ce>  abandoned; surely it belongs to someone nearby, but
<ce>  they have been momentarily careless.
<ce>  
<ce>  Do you attempt to take it for yourself?

Message:  1011
<ce>    This is no business for you. You ignore it.

Message:  1012
<ce>  An angry shout from the nearby owner
<ce>  brings you up straight.
<ce>  The guards are already on their way;
<ce>  not even returning the bag would
<ce>  get you out of this.
<ce>  You'll need some way to escape.

Message:  1013
<ce>  You've hidden it away before anyone can notice.
