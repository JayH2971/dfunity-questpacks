<ce>        You find a small bag of gold at your feet, presumably
<ce>                 your payment for completing the job.

<ce>                  A tired-looking warrior hails you.
<ce>
<ce>         "Hi. I'm giving up on a task from the Fighters Guild
<ce>          here in town to kill some rats infesting a house.
<ce>            Turns out I got the plague halfway through and
<ce>            have to spend my savings at the temple. If you
<ce>             want to go in and clean the rest, I'll split
<ce>                    the reward with you. You in?"
                                     <--->
<ce>         A warrior spattered with blood all around hails you.
<ce>
<ce>         "Hail. I have an assignment from the Fighters Guild
<ce>         to kill a few rats in a local house, but they're tougher
<ce>          than I thought. Think I've got an illness. It'll take
<ce>         everything I earned this week to get a cure, and I'm
<ce>        not risking that again. Want take over the contract?
<ce>         Kill the remaining rats and I'll split it with you,
<ce>                           half and half."

<ce>             "Maybe you're smarter than I am. This guild
<ce>             doesn't have your back when things get bad."
<ce>
<ce>          The wounded warrior heads off to find the temple.
                                     <--->
<ce>                   "Oh well. It was worth a shot."
<ce>
<ce>                 The fighter moves on to find a cure.
                                     <--->
<ce>                 "Maybe it's for the better. I should
<ce>                       head back to the farm."
<ce>
<ce>                    The warrior leaves you alone.

Message:  1013
<ce>                  "It's called _place_, %di from here.
<ce>              I think there's about 18 hours left before
<ce>            they call the contract. If you can kill them,
<ce>          I'll come back and make sure you get the payment."
<ce>
<ce>                The warrior heads off to find a cure.

Message:  1014
<ce>                      This is indeed the house.
<ce>                    The smell of rodent is strong.

Message:  1015
<ce>                   Sounds like that's all of them.
<ce>          You don't hear anything else moving in the house.
