<ce>  (ATTRIBUTE CHECK PASSED: PERSONALITY)
<ce>
<ce>  When it's your turn, your voice captivates the audience.
<ce>  They all pause and seem to freeze in time,
<ce>  held in suspense as you glide from one note to another.
<ce>  Your performance feels all too short, for once it's over,
<ce>  they throw coins at your feet with loud yells of appreciation.
<ce>  Some cheering ensues before the next singer begins,
<ce>  and you slip out of the crowd after gathering your gains.

Message:  1010
<ce>  Some of the peasantry here in ___town_
<ce>  have organized a singing circle, attempting to gain some
<ce>  merriment for a day. Anyone who feels so inclined can
<ce>  enter the circle and sing a chosen song.
<ce>  While their standards don't seem exceptionally high,
<ce>  no one has met them yet.
<ce>  Do you attempt to join the circle?

Message:  1011
<ce>  Merriment and singing are all well and good,
<ce>  but you have other things to be doing.

Message:  1012
<ce>  (ATTRIBUTE CHECK FAILED: PERSONALITY)
<ce> 
<ce>  You take your place on the edge of the crowd
<ce>  and prepare to sing. You try your best, but
<ce>  the crowd is not impressed. Some fair-minded
<ce>  folks block the various objects hurled at you,
<ce>  and soon you take the hint and leave.
