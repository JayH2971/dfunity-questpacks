<ce>  (SKILL CHECK PASSED!)
<ce>  
<ce>  When your turn comes, you stand before the peddler
<ce>  and ready your stance. You summon up all your confidence
<ce>  and throw your hand forward, shattering the steel block
<ce>  into pieces. The crowd roars with approval, and the
<ce>  showman offers you the somewhat paltry reward.

Message:  1010
<ce>  A sly-looking huckster displays a brick
<ce>  and calls out at passers by, apparently
<ce>  in the middle of a multi-stage attraction.
<ce>  
<ce>       "Ho there! I have here a slab
<ce>  of solid steel, impervious to weaponry!
<ce>  But I'm convinced that someone here
<ce>  is capable of punching right through it!
<ce>  You there! Or you! Which of you wants
<ce>  to give it a try?"
<ce>  
<ce>  He proffers a small bag of gold for the
<ce>  one who can break the block. Will you try?

Message:  1011
<ce>  You could make quite a spectacle of yourself
<ce>  if the challenge went badly for you.
<ce>  Others take your place, injuring their
<ce>  appendages quite seriously.

<ce>  (SKILL CHECK FAILED)
<ce>  
<ce>  When your turn comes, you stand before the peddler
<ce>  and ready your stance. You summon up all your confidence
<ce>  and throw your hand forward, earning a loud cracking sound
<ce>  and a deep, reverberating pain. Various reactions of
<ce>  amusement and pity run through the spectators
<ce>  as you shamefully withdraw, your pride wounded even
<ce>  more than your hand.
