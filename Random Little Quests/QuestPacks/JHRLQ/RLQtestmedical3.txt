Message:  1010
<ce>       A villager accosts you, covered in serious and repugnant
<ce>           sores. He tells you that he has leprosy, and the
<ce>         temple refuses to treat him for the severity of it.
<ce>      Though he has nothing to pay you with, he begs for a cure,
<ce>              as the illness rapidly consumes his life.
<ce>
<ce>                     Do you attempt to heal him?
<ce>
<ce>                 (YES: Skill check, Medical, high; or
<ce>               (YES: Skill check, Restoration, medium)

Message:  1011
<ce>          You turn away from the leper, hoping his affliction
<ce>                 doesn't affect you in some way.

<ce>                        (SKILL CHECKS FAILED)
<ce>
<ce>           You overestimate your abilities as you approach.
<ce>       Just as the temple healers failed to cure him by magic,
<ce>       you are also unable. Your medical skill is also lacking.
<ce>     You make a few disappointing attempts, but achieve nothing.
<ce>             Tears fill the man's eyes as he turns away,
<ce>                waiting for another savior to arrive.

<ce>                    (SKILL CHECK PASSED: MEDICAL)
<ce>
<ce>       His case is quite advanced, and a lesser physician would
<ce>               be lost. But you've seen enough to know
<ce>     an obvious cure. A nearby townsperson brings a few herbs at
<ce>           your request, and you mix them to make a potion.
<ce>                Upon drinking it, the leper is cured.
<ce>      A few wide-eyed villagers watch in awe as his sores heal.
<ce>
<ce>                  "A miracle! It's a miracle! %oth!"
<ce>
<ce>         He then runs through the streets, shouting for joy.
<ce>                  It appears your reputation in %crn
<ce>                    is about to improve a little.

<ce>                  (SKILL CHECK PASSED: RESTORATION)
<ce>
<ce>   His case is quite advanced, enough to daunt the temple healers.
<ce>         But you approach unafraid and attempt magic on him.
<ce>    It takes a few castings, but soon enough, the leper is cured.
