<ce>               You take a seat with the other students.
<ce>                As promised, you hear a great deal about the
<ce>           applications of thaumaturgy through a lengthy discourse.
<ce>            Though some others are disappointed that they
<ce>          failed to learn how to control the weather today,
<ce>          you gained enough to make your payment worth it.
<ce>  You look forward to practicing more thaumaturgy on your own time.

<ce>             An enterprising spellcaster takes advantage
<ce>           of the rainy weather to advertise a small class
<ce>         on the benefits of using the Water Walking spell to
<ce>        move through the rain. If you stay for the three-hour
<ce>        class, you'll need to pay 150 gold pieces, but you can
<ce>        tell you'd learn quite a bit about thaumaturgy.
<ce>               Pay for entry into the class?

Message:  1011
<ce>         You let others join the class, preferring some place
<ce>  without rain to drench you for the time being.

Message:  1012
<ce>         You search for 150 gold pieces but don't find them.
<ce>  The class soon starts without you.
