<ce>                You step forward and present the gold.
<ce>                He counts them out and then takes you
<ce>          through a series of mock scenarios, including some
<ce>         hypothetical court cases. Much of what he says goes over
<ce>         your head, but you feel yourself assimilating a little
<ce>         of his speech, his mannerisms, his way of thinking.
<ce>           The three hours fly by, after which he packs up his
<ce>            teaching aides, declaring his work day over.

<ce>           A man with a dapper outfit and a pleasant voice
<ce>         advertises lessons in court speech and fine oratory.
<ce>        He specifically mentions that his expertise is helping
<ce>         people debate their way out of criminal accusations.
<ce>        For a paltry fee of 300 coins, he is willing to train
<ce>                 you or anyone else for three hours. Will you
<ce>             learn some finer points of etiquette from him?

Message:  1011
<ce>            You keep your money and let someone else learn
<ce>                  from this well-dressed fellow.

Message:  1012
<ce>             You scrounge around your pockets but do not
<ce>           find 300 gold coins. Finding no willing clients,
<ce>            he sighs and moves to another part of the town.
