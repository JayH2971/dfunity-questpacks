<ce>             After counting out the coins, the armsmaster
<ce>             smiles broadly and takes a fighting stance.
<ce>              You enjoy three hours of arduous practice,
<ce>         with some villagers pausing to watch your sparring.
<ce>              After the session ends, the weaponsmaster bows deeply
<ce>            and thanks you for your patronage before heading home.

<ce>              An elderly, but agile, weaponsmaster shows
<ce>            some clever attacks and techniques nearby for
<ce>         anyone interested in gaining skill with Long Blades.
<ce>       For 250 gold, you can learn from him to fight better

<ce>         Though there is much to learn here, the lesson will
<ce>             have to be for someone else. You move on.

<ce>            Eager to learn, you search among your pockets
<ce>                   but do not find 250 gold pieces.
<ce>          Before you have a chance to gather up more money,
<ce>         someone else takes up the armsmaster's invitation.
<ce>                  You've lost this opportunity.
