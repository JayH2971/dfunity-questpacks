<ce>           basic first aid, to solve small problems without
<ce>         requiring the temple's healers.
<ce>      They offer a demonstrative clinic, charging
<ce>        200 gold pieces per head to teach mending basic wounds.
<ce>                The full lesson will take three hours.
<ce>                   Do you apply to learn from them?

<ce>           gold pieces readily available. The class starts without you.
