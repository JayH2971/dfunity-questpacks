QuestComplete:   [1004]
<ce>  After feeding in 300 gold pieces, you sit down
<ce>  and survey the contents of the book.
<ce>  It has far more material than even three hours could
<ce>  cover. You gain what you can from it, and when
<ce>  your allotted time is over, the tome disappears from
<ce>  view along with the pouch.

Message:  1010
<ce>  You notice a book chained to a nearby wall,
<ce>  replete with magical seals. Next to it hangs
<ce>  a pouch with a note.
<ce>  
<ce>  "300 gold to read book for three hours.
<ce>  Learn the fine art of mysticism.
<ce>  Book will be relocated at owner's pleasure."
<ce>  
<ce>  The pouch is just barely open enough to fit
<ce>  coins into its mouth. Do you take advantage
<ce>  of the opportunity?

Message:  1011
<ce>  You continue on without trying it. After a few
<ce>  moments you look back by chance and notice that
<ce>  the book and pouch are no longer visible.

Message:  1012
<ce>  You search and search but cannot find 300 gold
<ce>  coins among your things. You'll have to forego
<ce>  the lesson this time. After a few
<ce>  moments you look back by chance and notice that
<ce>  the book and pouch are no longer visible.
