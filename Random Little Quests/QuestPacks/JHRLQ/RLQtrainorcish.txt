<ce>             You notice a book chained to a nearby wall,
<ce>             replete with magical seals. Next to it hangs
<ce>                         a pouch with a note.
<ce>
<ce>           "Bilingual dictionary. Target language: Orcish.
<ce>     Book will open upon placing 250 gold coins within the pouch.
<ce>  Three hours' availability at a time."
<ce>
<ce>  The pouch is just barely open enough to fit
<ce>  coins into its mouth. Do you take advantage
<ce>  of the opportunity?

<ce>  You continue on without trying it. After a few
<ce>  moments you look back by chance and notice that
<ce>  the book and pouch are no longer visible.

Message:  1012
<ce>  You search and search but cannot find 250 gold
<ce>  coins among your things. You'll have to forego
<ce>  the lesson this time. After a few
<ce>  moments you look back by chance and notice that
<ce>  the book and pouch are no longer visible.

<ce>            After feeding in 250 gold pieces, you sit down
<ce>                 and survey the contents of the book.
<ce>          It has useful suggestions for pronunciation in the
<ce>            Orcish language, and some tables for grammar.
<ce>         Your three hours are well spent, at the end of which
<ce>         the book disappears entirely, along with the pouch.
