Message:  1010
<ce>           A hissing sound nearby makes your ears perk up.
<ce>      A feral vampire has come to the town, seeking sustenance.
<ce>        You could fight her if you felt brave. Do you attack?

Message:  1011
<ce>            You call for the vampire's attention,
<ce>                and she gladly closes in on you.

Message:  1012
<ce>           The vampire falls, and her belongings are yours
<ce>          to take. A member of the city watch approaches and
<ce>   gives you thanks and praise for keeping the town safe.

Message:  1013
<ce>     You keep out of the vampire's sight. As she starts searching
<ce>     for prey, she encounters multiple members of the town guard,
<ce>   who destroy her with ease.
