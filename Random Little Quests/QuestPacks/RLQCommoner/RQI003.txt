<ce>            "Oh! Sorry, I was reading from this book here.
<ce>            It's from the Mages Guild. It has introductory
<ce>           exercises in mathematics. Say, if you have a few
<ce>             moments, would you do some problems with me?
<ce>               I have some spare money here as payment
<ce>              if you want to help me work through them."

<ce>                  "Okay, hold on. Let me fix that...
<ce>       And that's it! Yes, that's the whole exercise finished.
<ce>              Thank you for going through them with me.
<ce>            I feel a bit more confident! Have this gold."

<ce>   It's missing this part here. Four plus five is nine, isn't it?"

<ce>                    "Let's see, first equation...
<ce>   It's missing this part here. Two plus seven is nine, isn't it?"

Message:  1012
<ce>      "Yes, of course it's nine. I shouldn't even be hesitating.
<ce>                    Sorry, a little nervous here.
<ce>        Okay, next part. Three times four is fourteen, right?"

<ce>      "Yes, of course it's nine. I shouldn't even be hesitating.
<ce>                    Sorry, a little nervous here.
<ce>        Okay, next part. Two times eight is fourteen, right?"

Message:  1013
<ce> "You're right, not fourteen. Yes, let me correct that. The formula works out!
<ce>
<ce>     "Okay, next section. Fifteen times five... is seventy five?"
                                     <--->
<ce> "You're right, not fourteen. Yes, let me correct that. The formula works out!
<ce>
<ce> "Okay, next section. Two hundred and fifty divided by ten is... twenty five?"

Message:  1014
<ce>   "Good! Yes, the formula continues. Let me carry over that value.
<ce>Um, this next part. One hundred divided by five is twenty, isn't it?"
                                     <--->
<ce>   "Good! Yes, the formula continues. Let me carry over that value.
<ce> Um, this next part. Twenty-two divided by eleven has to be two, isn't it?"

Message:  1015
<ce>   "Okay, almost done. Now I just need to find the circumference...
<ce>       oh bother. Um, this circle... No, the diameter. Hold on.
<ce>       Yes, the diameter of a circle that's twelve meters long.
<ce>                         Is that six meters?"
                                     <--->

<ce>       Your patron takes a moment and incorporates that answer
<ce>       into the next question. However, the answer doesn't fit,
<ce>          and soon the whole formula begins to malfunction.
<ce>         Once it is discovered that your guidance was wrong,
<ce>               any promise of payment is null and void.
<ce>             The book is closed and the activity is over.
