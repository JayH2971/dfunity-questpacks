<ce>         A raven, jet black, drops a folded letter near you.
<ce>        You pick it up and see the words written on the flap,
<ce>                           "For %pcf only."

Message:  1011
Greetings, %pcf. I suppose this will put our
interpreter gems to the test, now won't it? (Charvek-si)
<ce>
Greetings indeed. We have consulted among ourselves
and decided that you need to speak to Medora and
Nulfaga. (Karethys)
<ce>
Nulfaga is the mother of the recently slain King Lysandus
of Daggerfall. She lives in a castle called Shedungent,
hidden away in the Dragontail Mountains. It's quite a trip.
See the back side of this letter for its location.
Tell her door to shut up. Popudax thinks he remembers
some treasure in her castle that'd be useful. (Karethys)
<ce>
Medora resides in her tower on the Isle of Balfiera.
The Emperor's letter said Numidium is outside the tower,
so maybe she would know something about it. She doesn't
have any loyalty to anyone. With any luck she'll listen
to reason and give us some direction on activating
Numidium or finding the Totem. (Charvek-si)
<ce>
Both women are among of the most powerful magicians
in all Tamriel. If we speak of arcane objects capable
of destroying the world, they should know. (Karethys)
<ce>
Be careful out there. People who find out are starting
to give in to their base emotions. The Bay has always
been dangerous, but things are getting worse than ever.
The sooner you can get the Totem into responsible hands,
the sooner you can leave this all behind. (Charvek-si)

 In Shedungent I found a wand capable of opening
 small portals across space. It doesn't have enough
 power to send a human through, but it should
 suffice for a fairly small object.

%qdt:
 Medora Direnni told me to search under Sentinel Castle,
 where I found a telescope aimed at Castle Llugwych.
 A button on the device cast some kind of spell on me.
 If the thing's purpose is to reveal the Totem,
 that spell will probably only help.
