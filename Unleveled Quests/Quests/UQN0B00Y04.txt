<ce>                       We need you to get a rare
<ce>                       ingredient that is hidden
<ce>                       away in a nearby dungeon.
<ce>                        You will get a finder's
<ce>                       fee of _gold_ gold pieces.
<ce>                          Are you interested?
                                     <--->
<ce>                  One of our more brilliant students
<ce>                    is absolutely mad for something
<ce>                          called _ingredient_,
<ce>                   which we haven't had much call for
<ce>                   before. Would you, if it's not too
<ce>                    much of a bother, scurry on over
<ce>                     to this particular locale and
<ce>                           grab some for us?

<ce>                     Humph. I hope the next guild
<ce>                        member is more helpful.

AcceptQuest:  [1002]
<ce>                         An excellent attitude
<ce>                         %pcf. You are looking
<ce>                        for _ingredient_, which
<ce>                      can be found in ___dungeon_.
<ce>                     You have =traveltime_ days to
<ce>                             bring it back.

<ce>                        I suppose this will do.
<ce>                       Couldn't you have brought
<ce>                       back a fresher sample? The
<ce>                        quality of guild members
<ce>                       just isn't what it used to
<ce>                         be. Well, here is your
<ce>                          finder's fee, %pcf.

RumorsPostfailure:  [1006]
_qgiver_ has been complaining about the quality of Mages Guildmembers.

QuestorPostsuccess:  [1008]
Well, after getting that _ingredient_, how can I not be happy to see you?

QuestorPostfailure:  [1009]
<ce>                  We really needed that _ingredient_.
<ce>                I guess we know better now than to trust
<ce>                   you with any important assignment.

 I was asked to find a sample of
 _ingredient_ that is
 supposed to be hidden away
 in ___dungeon_.
 _qgiver_ of the Mages
 Guild of ___qgiver_
 gave me =traveltime_ days to get
 it back to %g2.

<ce>                   This looks like the _ingredient_
<ce>                            _qgiver_ wanted.

QuestTimeLapse:  [1045]
<ce>                      You suddenly remember that
<ce>                       _qgiver_ had asked you to
<ce>                      bring him a _ingredient_ by
<ce>                      today.  %g will no doubt be
<ce>                             disappointed.
