Installation:

Copy the contents of this zip file into the Streaming_Assets folder of your Daggerfall Unity installation. Replace everything. It should replace some files in your Quests and Tables folders.


Uninstallation:

In the Tables folder, delete QuestList-Classic.txt, and rename ORIGINALQuestList-Classic.txt to QuestList-Classic.txt.

Usage: Intended to be used with "Unleveled Mobs," though it works on its own.

Balancing will be attempted based on feedback.

This alters many of the quests in the game. Not all things will be as you remember. Some enemies will be replaced with tougher ones. Some quests will lead to very hard dungeons if Unleveled Mobs is instsalled. Some rewards will be different. Do not report these changes as bugs to the DFU developers, as they belong to this mod.

Knightly Orders are now very difficult. The Dark Brotherhood and the Fighters Guild are much easier to start with, whereas temples and mages guilds are intermediate. Commoner, noble, witch, and vampire quests can send you anywhere like normal -- beware!
