<ce>  A small pouch accompanies the letter, which has
<ce>  a dimension-warping enchantment placed on it.
<ce>  The actual sum of gold is more than was obvious from the outset.

Message:  1010
<ce>  You receive a letter. It carries a unique seal, containing the word "MAGNESSEN" in stylized print.

Message:  1011
Dear %pcf,
<ce>
I write first to congratulate you on your
successful sealing away of the spirit of Ganlas.
My brother told us the whole tale,
as well as your many sacrifices to help him.
His mind is sharp as ever, but I worry his body may never fully recuperate.
He is currently stationed to the Emperor's throne room.
The two of them never like to be apart for long.
<ce>
The Emperor's praise for you has been effuse.
He had a hard time thinking of an appopriate reward for you.
Gold isn't amassed very often here in Cyrodiil,
but I suppose it's better than nothing.
His Lordship has you in very high esteem,
and if you ever get the chance to visit the Imperial City,
your name will be well-known here.
<ce>
No one is quite sure what to do regarding Ganlas.
Ocato suggested allowing someone of lesser importance
to be possessed and thrown into a portal...
Don't tell anyone I said that. I hope we find a more civilized
solution before that spirit rises again. The Emperor
has been given no sight concerning this matter,
which is troubling.
But perhaps we won't have to worry about its rising at all.
<ce>
I usually end a letter when I begin rambling, so I will do so now.
The Magnessens and the imperial court
send you their greetings. Enclosed is a certificate
worth a sum of gold. You may redeem it at any bank
in the Iliac Bay.
<ce>
Safe travels. Brisienna.
