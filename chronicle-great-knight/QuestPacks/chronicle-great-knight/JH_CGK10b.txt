Dear %pcf,
<ce>
Our correspondence with Castle Daggerfall over the
past few weeks has revealed much concerning the matter of Ganlas to us.
Popudax knew about the charm, but he was too moralistic
to even suggest opening a portal with it.
My brother had too much knowledge for his own good.
I miss him, terribly.
<ce>
The Emperor wept for hours upon hearing that his
Great Knight had been sent to the outer realms.
He knew that was precisely what his champion would have wanted.
The foe is defeated, and cannot return.
At least, we hope nobody figures out how to open portals from Oblivion.
Pray that never happens. A great funeral was held for Lord Magnessen,
and the Emperor gave the finest eulogy I've ever heard.
I never even knew my brother spent two years in Black Marsh!
What else had he been keeping from me?
<ce>
I apologize for the casual spirit of this letter.
The Emperor gathered up what gold he could to reward
you. He holds you in very high esteem, and should you
ever come by the Imperial City, do make a visit
to the palace. The door will be open to you.
<ce>
Enclosed is a certificate worth a sum of gold.
You may redeem it at any bank in the Iliac Bay.
<ce>
            Brisienna.
