QuestComplete:   [1004]
<ce>  You reach in and find a decrepit pouch of gold
<ce>  within the hole. It looks years old, and carries
<ce>  no name. You ensure no one nearby cares as you
<ce>  take it for yourself.

Message:  1010
<ce>  You see a small hole in the ground here,
<ce>  distinct from the nearby terrain.
<ce>  It looks like it goes fairly deep.
<ce>  Do you try to reach in and see if
<ce>  anything is inside?

Message:  1011
<ce>  You reach in and are surprised by the feel
<ce>  of something furry within. You retract your
<ce>  hand but have already disturbed the
<ce>  denizen. An angry bat flies out to
<ce>  attack you in self-defense.

Message:  1012
<ce>  You reach in and find nothing at all.
<ce>  Perhaps this is the den of some creature,
<ce>  but it isn't home. You move on.

Message:  1013
<ce>  Some holes simply don't need to be explored.
<ce>  You leave this one alone.
